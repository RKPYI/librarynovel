      <h4>
        Chapter 217-1: Why did the Immortal descend to this mortal world, So as
        not to be like a man on the demon’s way (1)
      </h4>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        This divine light that pierced through the sky seemed to have broken
        through many universes and spaces as it suddenly landed here.
      </p>
      <p>
        After taking back the Domain Breaking Artifact, Gu Changge's figure
        walked from the crater.
      </p>
      <p>
        His face was blurred, and the real face could not be seen in the fog.
      </p>
      <p>
        His white robe was fluttering, the sleeves were wide, the immortal bones
        were beautiful, and he stood with his hands behind his back. His
        expression was calm, and he overlooked the magnificent mountains, rivers
        and territories below.
      </p>
      <p>
        With such an appearance, he seemed to be more and more rich, divine and
        otherworldly.
      </p>
      <p>"It seems that the spatial coordinates were not wrong."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded slightly and closed his eyes to perceive the laws of
        Heaven and Earth here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heavenly Star Realm was a Lower Realm that was infinitely far away
        from the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge had not depended on Yue Mingkong and followed her aura, it
        would be difficult for him to imagine that the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor from this life would come out of this place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Judging from the space obstacle avoidance here. At most, cultivators at
        the level of the Sacred Realm could appear in this world, and the upper
        limit was the Great Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        There might also be some Quasi-Supreme existences who, due to special
        reasons, sealed their blood, did not choose to ascend, and were hidden
        in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, since the Son of Luck like the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor could be born here, this world must not be too simple. The
        world's fortune in the first place seems magnificent and prosperous."
      </p>
      <p>
        While Gu Changge was talking to himself, a mist rose up all over his
        body, which became more and more vague and mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless it was someone who was particularly familiar with him, it would
        be difficult for someone to recognize him by this appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Heavenly Star realm, apart from Yue Mingkong and the people she
        brought, there should be no one who would recognize his identity for the
        time being.
      </p>
      <p>
        But to be on the safer side, Gu Changge still didn't plan to reveal his
        true face easily.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, before this, he might startle the snake.</p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Gu Changge also wanted to prevent Yue Mingkong from
        noticing something, and also prevent the powerhouses in this world from
        noticing the abnormality.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, the people from the Human Ancestor Hall would find them
        sooner or later. If they found out that Gu Changge was also here… it
        would be very troublesome to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that time, his intentions toward the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor would become very dangerous once exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was even more detrimental to his plan to replace the Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The most urgent task now is to understand the information of this
        world, and then find out where Yue Mingkong is… Since she came to this
        world first, she should already know something."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge guessed in his heart.</p>
      <p>And soon, he also had a careful plan in his mind.</p>
      <p>"The light just now…how could it be human?"</p>
      <p>"Could this be an Immortal from the Upper Realm?"</p>
      <p>
        At this time, many creatures and cultivators who were attracted by the
        divine light appeared from all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        They looked at Gu Changge in front of them in shock and astonishment,
        who obviously hadn't reacted yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The divine light soaring into the sky just now seemed to tear the sky
        apart, and the momentum was terrifying. The forces and cultivators in a
        radius of nearly 10,000 miles were aware of it.
      </p>
      <p>"Greetings to the Immortal!"</p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>"Greetings to the Immortal!"</p>
      <p>
        After that, many people bowed their heads with great piety and respect,
        as if witnessing the legendary Immortal descending to the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, Gu Changge's body was drenched of celestial light making him
        seem extraordinary and unpredictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their eyes, this was no different from the exalted mentioned in the
        classics and rumors.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, they were all attracted by the divine light here, thinking
        that some artifact appeared but the vision was shocking.
      </p>
      <p>Yet they didn't expect to see such a mysterious man in white.</p>
      <p>
        This man's cultivation base was unfathomable. Just standing there, there
        was a feeling like he was the center of the world, which made their
        hearts palpitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rumors of ascending to the Upper Realm had always been circulating
        no matter which Lower Realm they were in, so they naturally knew the
        existence of the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The so-called soaring was easy, but descending to the Lower Realm was
        difficult.
      </p>
      <p>They also understood this.</p>
      <p>
        So in their opinion, the mysterious young man in front of them was far
        more powerful than any old monster that was about to ascend, thus they
        naturally treated him as an Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>"Can we ask why Mr. Immortal came to this mortal world?"</p>
      <p>At this moment, some brave cultivators asked Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        His expression was extremely respectful, revealing a strong sense of awe
        and caution, for fear that one would accidentally offend the other
        party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's eyes swept across the many cultivators and creatures who
        were shocked, but he was not surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even with the use of a Domain Breaking artifact, its momentum in the
        Lower World was still astonishing.
      </p>
      <p>It would be detected from at least within a radius of 10,000 miles.</p>
      <p>
        Before that, Gu Changge had already figured out the countermeasures, so
        he didn't care.
      </p>
      <p>"Is this Heavenly Star realm?"</p>
      <p>Now, hearing their words.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's eyes moved slightly, and he quickly understood the language
        of this world as he asked lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the language of this world was not a problem for him as a
        cultivator in the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>"Mr. Immortal, this realm is indeed Heavenly Star realm."</p>
      <p>
        The cultivator who asked Gu Changge just now was a bearded man with
        cultivation in the True God Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a radius of tens of thousands of miles he was also a hero, and
        his sound was shocking.
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, he immediately said with great respect.</p>
      <p>
        The rest of the cultivators and creatures which appeared in all
        directions, watched this scene with their mouths tightly closed, daring
        not to make a sound, so as not to disturb this Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>"Oh, looks like I'm in the right place."</p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded, his expression very calm.</p>
      <p>Hearing this, everyone's heart suddenly tightened.</p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, how difficult it was to go to the Lower Realm, it was
        thousands of times more difficult than flying to the Upper Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the Immortal in front of him just said that he was in the
        right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that going to the Lower Realm was only a very simple thing for
        him, and he could do it with a wave of his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, everyone was even more in awe of Gu Changge, their
        heads were almost down to their necks, and they didn't dare to look up.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's indifference with a high-spirited look that didn't put
        everyone in the eye was very normal to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the voice was very young, it might be the kind of great power
        of eternity who had been practicing for countless years.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was already a great grace that ants like them could talk to such an
        existence.
      </p>
      <p>"Tell me about this world."</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge glanced at the middle-aged cultivator in front of
        him, and said.
      </p>
      <p>"Reporting to Senior Immortal…"</p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged cultivator was shocked, and he didn't dare to ask any
        more questions, and he didn't dare to hide anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, he honestly explained it to Gu Changge in front of everyone.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p>
        After all, many powerful beings with eccentric personalities would not
        waste time asking like Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>They usually grab people directly and conduct a soul search.</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, he subconsciously believed that the Immortal in front of him
        had a relatively good personality, and was not someone who killed
        innocent people indiscriminately.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Heavenly Sacred Realm is divided into the eight domains, and the
        place where we are now is the Xuan domain."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Xuan domain is boundless, with vast terrain. There are large forces
        that have been inherited for hundreds of thousands of years, or even
        close to a million years. There are many Ancient Clans, Sacred Places,
        and Sacred Mountains…"
      </p>
      <p>
        "The ruler is a force called Taixu Sect. Their ancestors flew to the
        Upper Realm 800,000 years ago, leaving behind their cultivation
        technique."
      </p>
      <p>
        "In addition to this, there are three major forces that compete against
        each other, but these forces are slightly inferior to the Taixu Sect."
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge's eyes flashed slightly, and he also understood some
        power information from the explanation of the middle-aged cultivator.
        Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m
      </p>
      <p>It was similar to the routine he had always known.</p>
      <p>
        And the reason why he didn't directly use the method of searching souls
        was mainly because he found it troublesome.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, there were many people here, and he had just entered the
        Realm, and many things had not yet been arranged. Although such a
        ruthless method was simple and convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it also seemed that he cared about someone like a man in the demon's
        way.
      </p>
      <p>And it was not good for his next plan.</p>
      <p>
        If he wanted to know the whereabouts of the reincarnation of the Human
        Ancestor, relying on one person's strength was definitely not enough.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't know what methods Yue Mingkong had.</p>
      <p>
        But what Gu Changge had to do was to first control the strongest forces
        in this domain for his use.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the excuses that were easy to control, it was to find some broken
        forces waiting for revival, and then slowly develop and grow, it was
        purely a brain problem.
      </p>
      <p>Wasn't it useful to directly control the already developed forces?</p>
      <p>
        If one couldn't control it, it was purely a matter of lack of ability
        and means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also didn't understand why among those developmental routines
        in the previous life, they always liked to start from the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>He also thought that it was not good either.</p>
      <p>"This Xuan Domain, and it seems to be just right."</p>
      <p>
        Afterwards, Gu Changge nodded, his expression still flat, and asked,
        "Where is the Taixu Sect?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "This deity and their Ancestor are old acquaintances, and I owed him a
        favor back then. Now while passing through this world, I happened to
        repay this favor together."
      </p>
      <p>"Guide this deity, and I will reward you."</p>
      <p>
        As he said that, a terrifying seal with runes shrouded in golden light
        appeared in Gu Changge's palm, filled with a palpitating sacred
        prestige.
      </p>
      <p>
        His voice was flat, without ups and downs, as if he was talking about
        something small and unimportant.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in the ears of many cultivators and creatures nearby, there was
        undoubtedly a thunderous explosion, which made their heads buzz, and
        they were extremely shocked and horrified.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 217-2: Why did the Immortal descend to this mortal world, So as
        not to be like a man on the demon’s way (2)
      </h4>
      <p>Especially looking at the big golden seal in Gu Changge's palm.</p>
      <p>
        Everyone suddenly sucked in cold air, their eyes widened, filled with
        fiery light.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hiss!</strong></p>
      <p>Did they hear it right?</p>
      <p>That was a divine artifact!</p>
      <p>
        Just show the way and be gifted with a divine weapon, what kind of
        terrifying identity was this?
      </p>
      <p>
        One must know that the power behind them had been passed down for tens
        of thousands of years, and there was at most one Divine artifact or even
        Divine King artifact as their trump card.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the mysterious High Immortal in front of him gave this kind
        of thing at will.
      </p>
      <p>What kind of wealth was that?</p>
      <p>
        For a time, their eyes were turning green, and they were so jealous that
        they went crazy, and they almost shouted that they were willing to lead
        the way.
      </p>
      <p>"What? Immortal has something to do with Taixu Sect?"</p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, the middle-aged cultivator in front of Gu Changge was
        stunned for a moment, as if he didn't react.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately afterwards, he displayed a burst of ecstasy, looking
        extremely shocked and excited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of his identity, he happened to be an Outer Sect Deacon of Taixu
        Sect. He was ordered to guard an Ancient city and was the city ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, he saw the divine light rushing into the sky in the great
        wasteland, thinking that the Divine artifact was born, so he hurried to
        this place.
      </p>
      <p>That was what happened just now.</p>
      <p>
        He didn't expect that his luck would be so good. The mysterious and
        incomparably High Immortal in front of him actually had an old
        relationship with the Ancestors of their sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        One must know that their Ancestors 800,000 years ago were like a
        mythical figure!
      </p>
      <p>
        Didn't that mean that the Immortal in front of him was also a figure
        from that era?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, this middle-aged cultivator with a full beard was
        filled with awe.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also doubted whether Gu Changge would be their Taixu Sect's enemy,
        who came to attack from the Upper Realm, to destroy the lineage left by
        their Ancestors.
      </p>
      <p>But the possibility of this was very small.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge could descend to the Lower Realm, how terrifying his strength
        was? it was simply a matter of convenience.
      </p>
      <p>Did he need to go through such a big fuss?</p>
      <p>
        This was obviously a close relationship with their Taixu Sect Ancestors!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Mr. Immortal, there is no need for the Divine artifact. This villain
        does not deserve to have such things. Since you are going to Taixu Sect,
        it is just right, the villain can lead you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Because the villain happens to be a Deacon of the Outer Sect of Taixu
        Sect, and the dog is also a famous genius in Taixu Sect."
      </p>
      <p>
        The middle-aged cultivator's name was Zhao Wu. Looking at Gu Changge at
        this moment, he said with a humble and flattering expression, and
        immediately began to call himself a villain.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was extremely difficult for him to look away from the Divine artifact
        in Gu Changge’s hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that there were so many cultivators watching here, even
        if he wanted it, he couldn't keep it.
      </p>
      <p>After all, this was a Divine artifact!</p>
      <p>
        Although it was extremely rare, it was extremely attractive and if he
        was not careful, it would lead him to his death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many forces were short of Divine weapons to guard their heritage. If
        they knew about this, they would definitely try their best to grab it.

      <p>Did they still expect this Immortal to protect him? Dream it.</p>
      <p>
        Secondly, he felt that a Divine weapon that was unstable was not as
        valuable as the one that was valued by the Immortal in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>At this moment, listening to what Zhao Wu said.</p>
      <p>Many cultivators and creatures were also extremely shocked.</p>
      <p>
        Within a radius of 10,000 miles, Zhao Wu, as the city lord of Heiwu
        City, had always been known for his ruthless methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that he called himself a villain in front of Mr. Immortal, they were
        not surprised. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that they didn't expect that he would take the initiative to
        give up such a handy Divine weapon. It really made them envious and
        jealous!
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh? Little True God, are you actually indifferent to a Divine
        artifact?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge seemed to have a slight appreciation in his dull eyes at this
        time as he nodded and said,
      </p>
      <p>"Not bad. Lead the way, then."</p>
      <p>
        With just a look of admiration, a person in this small world would do
        things for him with all his heart, it was not a loss if you think about
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Zhao Wu's face immediately displayed ecstasy, and he saw
        Gu Changge's slightly admiring expression.
      </p>
      <p>This was extremely important to him!</p>
      <p>
        He still knew very well which one was more important when he gave up a
        Divine artifact to gain the attention of this Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe today was his chance to soar!</p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Zhao Wu was even more excited.</p>
      <p>
        Of course, they didn't know at all that Gu Changge never planned to give
        out the Divine Artifact from the beginning to the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Gu Changge swept away at random just now, and found that
        there were many cultivators in front of him, and the strongest one was
        only in the realm of True God.
      </p>
      <p>So who had the courage to ask for this Divine artifact?</p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge's purpose was just to make everyone understand that he
        had a very close relationship with the Ancestors of Taixu Sect, and he
        could even give away a divine artifact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, he didn't know or wasn’t interested in who the Ancestor of
        Taixu Sect was.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Gu Changge wanted was just such a justifiable reason, so that Taixu
        Sect could relax its vigilance and save a lot of time for his next plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presumably the entire Taixu Sect did not know when their Ancestors had
        friendship with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The matter of the Upper Realm was not something Gu Changge would
        interfere with. They knew that even if they believed… or not, it would
        not affect Gu Changge at all.
      </p>
      <p>Afterwards, there was a divine light here.</p>
      <p>
        Zhao Wu led the way for Gu Changge to return to the ancient city where
        he was stationed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a teleportation formation to the Taixu Sect, which was for
        returning to the mountain gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had expected that he would be valued by this Immortal, and his
        identity would rise in Taixu Sect.
      </p>
      <p>This made Zhao Wu extremely excited and delighted.</p>
      <p>
        A city lord who was in charge of an ancient city with a population of
        one million, in front of Gu Changge, was like a dog hugging master’s
        leg, very humble and flattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who didn't know the whole story would think that their eyes were
        dazzled and they were having hallucinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many cultivators and creatures were still very envious of this,
        they only hated the fact that they were timid at the time, and didn't go
        to ask a question first.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe the dog beside Gu Changge now would be them!</p>
      <p>"One slip of a step can lead to eternal hatred!"</p>
      <p>
        Many people beat their chests and feet, and missed a good opportunity to
        hug the thigh of this Immortal.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, what happened in this great wasteland, as if it had grown
        wings, spread rapidly among the Major Ancient Cities and forces, causing
        a huge sensation.

      </div>
      <p>
        An Immortal who descended from the Upper Realm, mysterious and
        terrifying, beyond words.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had an old relationship with the ancestor of Taixu Sect and owed him
        a favor, and was now heading to Taixu Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        This matter was like a meteorite smashing into the deep sea, quickly
        setting off a terrifying frenzy, like a big earthquake!
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultivators who heard the news were all shocked, their eyes widened,
        and they were dumbfounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Taixu Sect was now a powerful force in the Xuan Domain, with a
        strong foundation and profound strength, and it was vaguely known as the
        top sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there were no other three sacred places to compete with it, then
        presumably the entire Xuan Domain would become the world of the Taixu
        Sect.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, there was a strong Immortal who had come, and he was a friend
        of their Old Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        This news made the other three Sacred places despair, and felt that
        their good days to compete with the Taixu Sect were coming to an end.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, there were many cultivators and creatures who witnessed this
        incident with their own eyes, so they couldn't be fake.
      </p>
      <p>
        The white robe of the High Immortal fluttered, his face was blurred, and
        the immortal mist was lingering, and his head and feet were full of
        otherworldly auras, as if even the heavens and the earth could be
        covered by his palm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under such astonishing rumors, it caused huge waves in the entire Xuan
        Domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side, the flood domain, that was hundreds of millions of
        distances away from Xuan domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an incomparably tall ancient city, Yue Mingkong, dressed in plain
        white clothes and wearing a veil on her face, was in a quiet and remote
        pavilion.
      </p>
      <p>
        She frowned slightly, crossed out the names of some forces in her hands,
        and muttered to herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "According to the timeline, reincarnation of the Human Ancestor at this
        time should have been a little famous. Why have I investigated so many
        forces and have never seen a genius with such a name."
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, she didn't know the exact location of the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>The only way to do it was to exclude one by one by name.</p>
      <p>The information she had was only two points.</p>
      <p>
        One was the name of the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor in this
        life, Jiang Yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second was that the reincarnation of the Human Ancestor had a
        certain powerful physique, which was suspected to be a rumored Holy
        Body.
      </p>
      <p>But she didn't know exactly what kind of physique it was.</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, Yue Mingkong subconsciously thought about which extremely
        famous genius would be.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she searched for the forces in the whole Domain but she had never
        heard of such a name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yue Mingkong was a little worried for a while, and planned to go to
        other domains to look for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Emperor Chu, news suddenly came from Xuan, saying that there is a
        powerful existence in the Lower Realm, who seems to have some origins
        with the Ancestors of Taixu sect in Xuan Domain…"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, outside the pavilion, there was a sudden wave of subtle
        fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>Then, the report sounded.</p>
      <p>"Xuan Domain?"</p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong frowned slightly.</p>
      <p>
        The location of the Heavenly Star Realm was very remote, and there were
        almost no Dao Lineage and large churches in the Upper Realm that noticed
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So she came quietly to the lower world, and did not attract anyone's
        attention, and even concealed it from Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Yue Mingkong didn't care about this news, thinking that it was just a
        coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ancestor of Taixu Sect, was probably someone from hundreds of
        thousands of years ago, and had nothing to do with her at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the Human Ancestor Hall might not have found this place.
      </p>
      <p>Yue Mingkong was slightly relieved.</p>
      <p>
        "The famous place of extreme sun in the Heavenly Star Realm, you must
        also pay attention to it. According to rumors, the Nirvana Green Lotus
        that grows in it seems to be very important to the reincarnation of the
        Human Ancestor."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It can help the Human Ancestor’s reincarnation to undergo physical
        transformation."
      </p>
      <p>
        She began to think about her next plan, but it was really impossible.
        First, she had to search all the eight Domains.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, she quietly descended to the Lower ealm this time, and she
        brought enough manpower, all of which were powerful, and there was no
        problem in sweeping one side.

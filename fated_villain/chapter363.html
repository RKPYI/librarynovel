          >Ji Chuyue, in a yellow dress, was gifted with a slender figure and a
          snowy face that was captivatingly glowing; her features were delicate,
          resembling fairies that trod the world, and every single soul in the
          universe would rejoice at a momentary smile of hers.</span

          >Jiang Chen had seen quite a number of beguiling damsels, and although
          most of them belonged to his greatest nemesis, Gu Changge, it
          didn&#8217;t stop him from enjoying the natural beauty before his
          eyes. Different from Xiao Ruoyin&#8217;s charm, Ji Chuyue&#8217;s
          appeals were her naturalness and flawlessness, like that of a lotus
          that rose onto the surface tranquil waters &#8211; an ornament of
          nature.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the meantime, Ji Chuyue was followed by her brother, Ji
          Yaoxing.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Why are you staring at me?&#8221; Ji
          Chuyue curiously asked as she approached.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Letting out a slight cough, Jiang Chen withdrew his gaze. Although he
          already figured that Ji Chuyao&#8217;s appearance when they first met
          wasn&#8217;t her original appearance but a disguise, he never expected
          her to be this stunningly beautiful.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Oh, I forgot!&#8221; Ji Chuyue suddenly exclaimed as she
          finally remembered that she reverted to her true appearance, which
          explained why Jiang Chen was staring at her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, that allowed her to regain some confidence. Earlier, when
          she was with Gu Changge, the man was completely indifferent, but not
          because of the change in her appearance. As such, Ji Chuyao was rather
          disaffected. After all, no woman in the world wouldn&#8217;t care
          about their appearance, even though she had hidden it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, at a wave of a hand, a layer of ambiguous gleam flashed
          across Ji Chuyue&#8217;s face and she changed back to her plain,
          unremarkable appearance.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon that, Jiang Chen was somewhat taken aback, realising that Ji
          Chuyue only reverted to her true appearance to meet with Gu Changge
          rather than to meet him. Although he felt somewhat disappointed and
          discomforted by it, he quickly regained his composure.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So, you&#8217;re a Divine Source Master, yourself?&#8221; Ji
          Yaoxing walked over and got straight to the point. There was a golden
          glow in each of his eyes, resembling a miniature sun, which he stared
          at Jiang Chen with, as if he could pierce him with his gaze.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Yes, I had practised a little with one of my Ancestors, but I
          merely know the basics.&#8221; Jiang Chen claimed honestly, unbothered
          by Ji Yaoxing&#8217;s glare.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;A Sacred Physique, indeed.&#8221; A trace of surprise surged
          on Ji Yao Xing&#8217;s face. As he also possessed a type of Sacred
          Physique, and could easily detect the position and motion of Jiang
          Chen&#8217;s Dantian.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although Jiang Chen had yet to create his Spiritual Sea, his Dnatian
          was like an alluring shade that resembled a star&#8217;s twinkle. With
          that in mind, he decided to trust Jiang Chen, thinking that he would
          make a fine sprout to cultivate.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Besides, if Jiang Chen was really a Divine Source Master, he would
          unconditionally welcome him into the Hidden Ji Family as the value of
          a Divine Source Master was tremendous.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Jiang Chen, didn&#8217;t you say you were a Successor of a
          Divine Source Master?&#8221; At that moment, Ji Chuyue also asked as
          curiosity arose in her eyes.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Having consulted the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of
          Creation in his mind, Jiang Chen was obviously confident. Upon the
          questioning and bafflement of Ji Chuyue and Ji Yaoxing, he simply
          waved his hand forward.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Out of nowhere, an inexplicable, heavenly sensation and aura flowed
          in the air, as if it was connected to the might of the universe,
          followed by deafening sounds of explosions, which certainly left the
          siblings stunned.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The mountains before them started to move as the grass, rocks, and
          bodies of water began to shift in different directions. It was as
          though they were moved by a pair of enormous, invisible hands.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seeing that, the siblings were in dismay, though they could still
          vaguely sense the shift in terrain and a force called
          &#8216;Shi&#8217;.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So this is the ability of a Divine Source Master… Reshaping
          the terrains without resorting to magic. How wonderful and
          mysterious…&#8221; Stupefaction surged in Ji Chuyue&#8217;s bewitching
          eyes as she stared at Jiang Chen without blinking.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Any cultivator could have done this without breaking a sweat,
          but he&#8217;s merely an ordinary person. No wonder the legacies of
          Divine Source Masters are known to be lost in the River of
          Time…&#8221; Ji Yaoxing glanced deeply at Jiang Chen, already
          convinced that he was actually a Divine Source Master.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The reemergence of a Divine Source Master—whose kind was lost in
          history—was surely to shock the world.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;See, Brother? I didn&#8217;t lie to you, did I?&#8221; Ji
          Chuyue beamingly smiled.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Jiang Chen is really a Divine Source Master. We can definitely
          find the Tower of World Domination even in the face of everyone
          now!&#8221; She confidently stated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Ji Yaoxing nodded as a trace of light flashed across
          his eyes.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;But there is something I must clarify to you.&#8221; At that
          moment, Jiang Chen was seemingly satisfied by the siblings&#8217;
          dumbfounded reactions. Although the earlier occurrence wasn&#8217;t
          exactly caused by him, it was at least shown to be cast through his
          own hands. The Artifact Spirit of the Celestial Boat of Creation
          indeed did not let him down, but he had yet to forget about another
          matter.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What is it? Tell us, and we promise to assist you as much as
          we can.&#8221; Ji Chuyue nodded with amiableness in her eyes, assuming
          that Jiang Chen was going to discuss conditions.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Actually, I have a grudge against Gu Changge.&#8221; With a
          calm expression, Jiang Chen accentuated his every word.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What…&#8221; Ji Yaoxing was stunned for a moment, wondering if
          he misheard Jiang Chen as his pupils contracted.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Jiang Chen said he has a grudge against Gu Changge? Given his
          identity and that of Gu Changge, how did he even manage to come in
          contact with him? No, wait. Why is he mentioning this out of
          nowhere?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Did you perhaps notice that Gu Changge is coming?&#8221;
          Swiftly realising that, Ji Chuyue sternly stared at Jiang Chen as she
          withdrew her smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since Gu Changge was involved in the matter, they couldn&#8217;t
          afford to take things likely. At the same time, Ji Yaoxing&#8217;s
          face, too, grew gloomy, obviously bothered.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As though Jiang Chen expected their reactions, he didn&#8217;t seem
          surprised. Instead, he serenely remarked, &#8220;I only told you this
          so you&#8217;ll keep your guards up. Otherwise, it&#8217;ll seem like
          I&#8217;m ensnaring you to my side. Secondly, I&#8217;m also not
          afraid that you&#8217;ll capture and send me to Gu
          Changge.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was confident with his contingency plan as the elderly man in
          black robes wasn&#8217;t far away from him, so the latter could come
          and bail him out anytime.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s not too late for you to tell us now.&#8221;
          Hearing that, Ji Chuyue felt quite relieved and revealed a smile.
          &#8220;Compared to the others, you&#8217;re a rather kind
          one.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Fortunately, Jiang Chen did not set them up to get straddled with the
          matter. Essentially, if Gu Changge were to think that they were allies
          with Jiang Chen, things would turn out bad and it might even cause a
          major disaster.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;To be honest, you don&#8217;t have to worry. I may bear a
          grudge against Gu Changge, but there&#8217;s no telling whether he
          still remembers me. After all, I&#8217;m merely an insignificant ant
          in his eyes, whom he can stomp to death whenever he wants.&#8221;
          Jiang Chen smiled, though the smile concealed bitterness and
          self-mockery as well as a hint of hatred.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon those words, Ji Chuyue understood that Gu Changge didn&#8217;t
          have a grudge against Jiang Chen, but the other way round, and that
          meant things were totally different. As such, their plans were now
          much easier since Gu Changge wouldn&#8217;t bother himself with such a
          trivial matter, and it didn&#8217;t matter to her how the feud between
          Jiang Chen and Gu Changge began in the first place.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Understood. For now, leave Heavenly Ruin Gate and pretend we
          didn&#8217;t just hear what you said.&#8221; At that moment Ji Yaoxing
          suddenly spoke without hesitation in his tone. Although he was an
          honest man, he was by no means a fool. Although Jiang Chen possessed a
          Sacred Physique and the legacy of a Divine Source Master, his feud
          with Gu Changge was enough to make him an unpredictable time
          bomb.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Brother, are you dense? Jiang Chen may bear a grudge against
          Gu Changge, but that doesn&#8217;t affect us in any way. If we were to
          be discovered by Gu Changge by then, we&#8217;ll simply deny to
          knowing anything.&#8221; Hearing that, Ji Chuyue hastily dragged her
          stern-faced brother to the side and whispered. &#8220;Do you still not
          get it? Jiang Chen hates Gu Changge, but Gu Changge may not know that
          Jiang Chen even exists, so why would he care about him?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;re saying…&#8221; Ji Yaoxing furrowed his brow as he
          was unable to comprehend her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;We can change Jiang Chen&#8217;s appearance. Since he&#8217;s
          an ordinary person, it&#8217;ll be easy to disguise him, and as long
          as Gu Changge doesn&#8217;t pay attention to him, he&#8217;ll never
          notice,&#8221; Ji Chuyue explained. &#8220;Besides, Jiang Chen is a
          Divine Source Master, and he can help us locate where the Tower or
          World Domination.&#8221;</span

          scowl for a while before eventually nodding.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          change his appearance all this time since he was concerned that he
          would be noticed by Gu Changge. Judging by Gu Changge&#8217;s
          personality, it was most likely that he wouldn&#8217;t let Jiang Chen
          off.</span

          >Accordingly, Ji Chuyue reached out her hands and changed Jiang
          Chen&#8217;s face from a dashing-looking man to a younger teenager. In
          that instant, even Jiang Chen&#8217;s closest acquaintances
          wouldn&#8217;t be able to identify him.</span

          hurrying over, so we must locate the Tower of World Domination as soon
          as possible,&#8221; Ji Chuyue stated with a wide smile as her eyes
          arched into crescents.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >And so, the three began formulating a strategy and decided to scour
          Sky Jade Mountain Range. According to Jiang Chen, the essences of the
          universe and lands were at their lowest during midnight. As the day
          moved to the next, everything would reset, and that was when anomalies
          that were not detectable during the way would appear.</span

          World Domination, it was indubitably great news, since they were
          purposelessly looking everywhere, as though they were wandering

          >Meanwhile, after conversing with the Artifact Spirit of the Celestial
          Boat of Creation, Jiang Chen began his preparation. Since the
          oappearance of the Tower of World Domination would cause a great
          commotion, he would need something to protect himself with once the
          attention was all on them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Feeling more relaxed, the two siblings of the Ji Family accordingly
          left, intending to rendezvous with Jiang Chen at night.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Not long after they left, a figure suddenly appeared behind Jiang
          Chen. It was that of the elderly man in black robes, who was donning a
          cold face, giving off an alarming sensation.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, the elderly man in black robes ignored him and reached
          out his icy palm before pressing it on Jiang Chen&#8217;s shoulder, as
          if he was investigating the result of his cultivation as of
          late.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In that instant, Jiang Chen could feel a surge of mysterious power
          flowing through his lungs and stopping at his Dantian.</span

          >&#8220;You truly disappoint me. The legacy of the Everchanging
          Demonic Arts was entrusted to you, yet you&#8217;ve achieved nothing.
          You haven&#8217;t even opened up your Spiritual Sea. This old one
          feels the urge to smack you to death and look for a new
          Successor,&#8221; the elderly man in black robes rebuked, and his
          voice was filled with coldness that startled Jiang Chen.</span

          possible for me to kill the other disciples, who clearly started
          cultivating early on.&#8221; Jiang Chen attempted to defend himself.
          Judging by his current strength, it was indeed difficult for him to
          engage anyone. After all, he would need to at least attain Spiritual
          Sea Realm first.</span

          Sacred Physique. All you had to do was absorb his cultivation power
          and you&#8217;d immediately achieve a breakthrough.&#8221; The elderly
          man in black robes icily added, &#8220;That little girl from the Ji
          Family, too, has an excellent physique. If you can&#8217;t bring
          yourself to do it, this old one is more than glad to

          refuse the idea, the elderly man in black robes already disappeared
          without giving him a chance to talk back.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With that in mind, Jiang Chen remained subconsciously worried.
          Essentially, if the elderly man in black robes, given his formidable
          strength, were to attack the two siblings of the Ji Family, they
          probably wouldn&#8217;t survive, while Jiang Chen, who was rather fond
          of the siblings, was reluctant to kill them.</span

          wondrous runes that transformed into black and white colours flashed
          across his eyes. In his eyes, the colours of the entire world changed
          as every shade signified certain rules, Fortuity, World Principles,
          terrains, Dragon Veins, and so on, all of which fell vividly into his
          vision.</span

          himself, he thought it was burdensome and time-consuming. Besides,

          retrieve it once the former located it.</span

          dark. He also knew of every detail, on how Jiang Chan successfully
          eliminated his target as well as hid their bodies. As such, he carried
          a fascinating grin. [Compared to the other Fortuitous Ones, Jiang Chen
          sure is bolder, more cautious, and more adaptive.]</span

          technique, you won&#8217;t be able to stop. After all, the feeling is
          like drugs, and is ever so addictive.] Gu Changge revealed a subtle
          grin as he had experienced such a sensation, which was also the terror
          of the Forbidden Demonic Arts.</span

          >As for the Demonic Seed, he had his Demonic Puppet plant it in Jiang
          Chen&#8217;s body, it was to help him control Jiang Chen better in the
          future and also to help Jiang Chen cultivate Everchanging Demonic Arts
          easier. After all, the purpose of Everchanging Demonic Arts was to let
          Jiang Chen grow into a potent Dao Fruit which he could harvest later

          out as he continued to develop in this direction. After all, this
          abnormal growth was perfectly fine for a Fortuitous One. It was just
          that he added his flavour into it. [I wonder if the gods would be

      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s father stood outside the Ancestral Hall, his face was very
        deep and calm, but he also had a faint worry.
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time, he looked into the deep Nirvana Pool and sensed the
        aura there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's cultivation base made him unable to infer clearly,
        sometimes he revealed the True God Realm, sometimes Heavenly God Realm,
        and even the Quasi-Sacred… This was the first time he had seen this kind
        of change, and he didn't know what to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er sat cross-legged there, with the immortal aura pervading her
        body, and among the newly born immortal bones, it was like a female
        immortal was sitting cross-legged, reciting scriptures for her rebirth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her aura was also increasing, but it was not as unpredictable as Gu
        Changge's.
      </p>
      <p>As for the other three, they were completely negligible.</p>
      <p>
        "Changge has his own fortune. As a father, I shouldn't ask too much, but
        I have to find a way to hide the existence of the demonic heart for
        him…"
      </p>
      <p>His father whispered, and many visions appeared in his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        Then he waved his hand, and a layer of fluctuations appeared, which
        separated the scenes here, and even the Ancestral Hall was also blocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless he walked in, it would be difficult for him to see what was going
        on inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was also good, it could isolate the fluctuation of the aura to the
        greatest extent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because at this time, it was necessary to strictly prevent the curiosity
        of the rest of the clan, and stop them from rushing to the clan to have
        a look, especially those Ancestors who had nothing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Nanshan, the Ancestor behind Gu Xian'er, seemed to be quite idle
        recently. He was very concerned about Gu Xian'er's second nirvana and
        wanted to know how she had changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If the old Ancestor comes here in a while, I have to find a way to hold
        him back."
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking of this, his father's expression gradually became serious, and
        with a wave of his sleeve, he closed the door of the main hall, while he
        was waiting outside the hall, not allowing others to approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In order to be safe, this is the only way. I believe in Changge's
        perseverance, and there will be no accidents."
      </p>
      <p>
        His father said to himself, this was the belief of a father in his son.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>
        At the same time, in the Ancestral Hall, there were thousands of
        Immortal fluctuations, divine lights, like a river, and even the faint
        light of immortality was permeating.
      </p>
      <p>The momentum in the Nirvana Pool was even more astonishing.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's figure was brilliant, motionless, and the aura of the
        person seemed to devour and wrap all the people in the vicinity, which
        made one's heart palpitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        His consciousness was very calm, and he did not want to be affected by
        the vision at this time like the others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nirvana Pool was originally created for the bloodline of the Gu
        family, providing opportunities for future generations to transform.
      </p>
      <p>
        But his talent was originally from a demonic heart, and many of the
        other talents were originally related to the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now more or less because of the relationship between the bloodlines
        they were also changing.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Humm!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Near the Nirvana Pool, layers of brilliance appeared, with different
        auras rising and falling, and many supreme talents such as reincarnation
        and space were manifested.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Gu Changge swallowed up many of the tyrannical talents of
        the young supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, they were also waking up. Gengjin, Zhiyang, Taiyin… all
        kinds of talents seemed to be mixed together which made it even more
        mysterious.
      </p>
      <p>At the end, it manifested a feeling of opening the sky in chaos.</p>
      <p>
        The detachment bones exchanged from the system store all roared at this
        time, and the order of the Dao burst out in it, falling like a waterfall
        of stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, Gu Changge didn't really care much about this. The Nirvana
        Pool had a great effect, but at most it would push his current
        cultivation to the middle stage of the Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        "However, the feeling faintly conveyed to me from this demonic heart,
        and the feeling of the Eight Desolate Devil Halberds at the beginning,
        are a little inexplicably familiar."
      </p>
      <p>"I am the Demon Lord?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge frowned, always feeling that the trouble caused by the other
        self in the demonic heart was definitely not just as simple as Gu
        Xian'er and Yue Mingkong.
      </p>
      <p>Although, the system had solved the drawbacks of the demonic heart.</p>
      <p>
        But whether it was the demonic nature or the current nature, it was all
        the same to him.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't think that what he did was very different from the demon.</p>
      <p>
        Speaking of which, this demonic nature was the root cause of Yue
        Mingkong being killed by him in her last life, and it was also the root
        cause of him digging out Gu Xian'er's Dao bone.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        These things were indeed done by himself, even if Gu Changge didn't want
        to admit it, of course, he still had to throw the blame on the demonic
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just judging from this aura, the origin of the demon heart is very
        ominous… The Nirvana Pool can reflect the past life. Wasn't I a
        transmigrator in my past life? Is there anything that can't be done?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge frowned slightly and felt a little tricky.</p>
      <p>
        It seemed to him that it had something to do with testing his heart.
      </p>
      <p>Soon, he didn't care.</p>
      <p>
        After all, whether it was Demonic Heart telling him the identity of the
        Demon Lord or anything else, it had nothing to do with him now.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the second point, the demonic property was just a more indifferent
        state for him… Gu Changge could now let it possess his mind at any time,
        thus reaching the point where he was too oblivious.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such a state, he would act absolutely indifferent, and he would no
        longer be like this, and he would not consider personal emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the demonic nature dominated, to what extent was emotional
        indifference? There would be no one other than himself in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge was definitely unwilling to accept this.</p>
      <p>What was the purpose of his cultivation?</p>
      <p>Naturally, it was for strength, not for betrayal.</p>
      <p>
        If he was dominated by demonic nature, then it was not much different
        from the self in the timeline that Yue Mingkong experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge didn't think that he was a good person, but he didn't think
        he was that indifferent to emotions either.
      </p>
      <p>More or less, Yue Mingkong and others were different for him.</p>
      <p>
        "The demonic heart can't affect me. At first, my consciousness was
        suppressed by it, but it was only because of its backlog for a long
        time…"
      </p>
      <p>Many thoughts flashed through Gu Changge's mind.</p>
      <p><strong>Bang bang bang! !</strong></p>
      <p>At this moment, he heard the sound of the demonic heart beating.</p>
      <p>
        This momentum was like a strong drum, beating between heaven and earth,
        making a heart-pounding sound.
      </p>
      <p>The monstrous demonic nature began to emerge from his heart.</p>
      <p>
        In the weapon space, the Eight Desolate Demon Halberd burst into cheers,
        as if rejoicing for its master's enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        The misty black light contained a certain aura that could make all
        worlds tremble, spraying from the blood vessels!
      </p>
      <p>
        As Gu Changge penetrated his own heart, he suddenly felt that there was
        a surging and ancient supreme aura in the demonic heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indistinctly, the sound of strange scriptures resounded, and there were
        countless sounds of bowing and chanting, ringing in his ears.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he looked closely, he would find that it was a Supreme Demon Lord
        overlooking the nine heavens and ten regions, the heavens and the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind him was a monstrous shadow, and amid the surging gray fog, he
        held a fierce halberd that threatened the universe and stood
        indifferently in the sky.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>The halberd swept and fell.</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, time and space collapsed and even the reincarnation collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire universe seemed to be split open, as if the real immortals
        under it fell, and the immortal king was slain!
      </p>
      <p>
        Although these pictures seem indescribable, they would make people crazy
        and fall into madness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the face of the demon lord was blurred, but Gu Changge could be
        sure that it was himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is my so-called past life? I was the demon lord in my past life?"
      </p>
      <p>"Or could it be a picture of the future?"</p>
      <p>
        In the next instant, Gu Changge had an epiphany, and the scene
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the dark, he felt that his demonic heart had transformed, producing
        an indescribable mysterious meaning.
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps it could be called an Immovable Demon Heart.</p>
      <p>However, it was up to him to find out what the benefits were.</p>
      <p>
        Soon, Gu Changge opened his eyes, and he took the initiative to withdraw
        from the state of absorbing the mysterious creation in the Nirvana Pool.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all… his simple purpose of entering the Nirvana Pool had been
        achieved, and then he would start with Gu Xian'er!
      </p>

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>A tragic and bitter drama, otherwise how would it be staged!</p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>In the next moment, Gu Changge's aura changed.</p>
      <p>A wisp of demonic energy began to emerge from his body.</p>
      <p>
        His face suddenly became indifferent, and the whole person's emotions
        seemed to be in nothingness, leaving only a shuddering indifference.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Dao was ruthless, then Gu Changge's current state was similar to
        Dao's.
      </p>
      <p>Too forgetful!</p>
      <p>"Young master!"</p>
      <p>"What's the matter? This is…"</p>
      <p>
        This shocking change instantly caught the attention of the three young
        supreme beings of the Gu family who were cultivating and transforming
        their bloodlines by the Nirvana Pool.
      </p>
      <p>They opened their eyes and saw this scene.</p>
      <p>They couldn't believe it.</p>
      <p>Their faces suddenly turned pale.</p>
      <p>
        Then, they hurriedly withdrew from the cultivation state, feeling a
        terrifying killing intent that completely enveloped them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole person was like falling into an ice cellar, their whole body
        was cold, and they didn't dare to move at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        They seemed to be the most humble ant under heaven, and the slightest
        thought would crush them to death.
      </p>
      <p>
        They couldn't understand why Gu Changge, who was cultivating so well,
        became like this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's appearance made them tremble, their bodies felt cold, and
        their souls seemed to be frozen!
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that as long as Gu Changge had a thought, the three of them
        would explode in the Nirvana Pool at this moment, and their body and
        spirit would be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master, we are from your clan…"</p>
      <p>"Young Master, wake up!"</p>
      <p>
        They trembled and said, intending to communicate with Gu Changge, trying
        to wake Gu Changge up.
      </p>
      <p>After all, it came too suddenly, and there was no preparation.</p>
      <p>Who knew that Gu Changge would suddenly become like this?</p>
      <p><strong>Puff!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked at them indifferently, as if watching a group of
        little ants at his feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that he didn't care about their lives, but the three of them
        still clearly saw that there was a clear struggle on his faces.
      </p>
      <p>It seemed… Gu Changge was very reluctant to become like this.</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be that the young master went into trouble and went wrong in
        his cultivation?"
      </p>
      <p>
        One person's voice was trembling, and he suddenly guessed that, after
        all, the current Gu Changge looked like the so-called demon, which was
        too similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        "How can a good person fall into a demon, go find the head of the family
        and the Clan Elder…" Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
      </p>
      <p>
        The other person said that he was going to go outside the hall,
        intending to call someone. They would definitely not be Gu Changge's
        opponents, and they couldn't even resist.
      </p>
      <p>But no one answered them.</p>
      <p>
        Seeing them escape, Gu Changge's expression moved slightly, still
        indifferent, and then waved his hand, and the surging five-colored
        divine light burst out.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Puff!</strong></p>
      <p>
        With a sound, the three of them flew upside down while vomiting blood,
        slammed into the wall behind, and passed out, not knowing whether they
        were alive or dead.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>
        This change also alarmed Gu Xian'er, who was in the cultivation state
        beside the Nirvana Pool at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was deeper into meditation than the rest, so she didn't perceive
        this change immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that she woke up and saw this scene, she was immediately stunned,
        shocked, dazed, and completely puzzled.
      </p>
      <p>
        She didn't know the life and death of the three, and she didn't have
        time to investigate.
      </p>
      <p>However, her response was also quick.</p>
      <p>
        She could see that Gu Changge's current state seemed very wrong,
        although it seemed normal, there was nothing strange about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that indifferent expression reminded her of the time when he dug out
        her Dao bone in her childhood.
      </p>
      <p>At that time, Gu Changge also looked at him indifferently.</p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 211-2: For the Demon Lord, it’s hard to suppress the devilish
        nature; The staging for a bitter and tragic drama (2)
      </h4>
      <p>This similar scene made Gu Xian'er's back feel astonishingly cold.</p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, what's wrong with you?" Gu Xian'er asked him, secretly
        vigilant in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aura revealed by Gu Changge at this moment had already reached the
        Quasi-Sacred Realm, not the True God Realm that was usually revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This surprised Gu Xian'er even more, and at the same time she became
        more and more vigilant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was really too strong, a Nirvana Pool couldn't make his
        cultivation progress so much at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        This only meant that Gu Changge's cultivation base had reached this
        level.
      </p>
      <p>He was just hiding it.</p>
      <p>And now, he had finally exposed it.</p>
      <p>
        "I'm still almost breaking through the False God realm. If Gu Changge
        wants to attack me, with my strength, it's impossible to stop him." Gu
        Xian'er knew this very well.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, a round dark golden sword pill appeared in her palm.</p>
      <p>There was a holy atmosphere in the air.</p>
      <p>This was a secret treasure.</p>
      <p>
        She felt that she could block Gu Changge for a while, and then she would
        take the opportunity to go outside the hall and call out to the rest of
        the clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, it would be very dangerous today. Gu Changge didn't know what
        was going on, but he was in the middle of the transformation of her
        bloodline, and he became like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did he forget the oath he made in front of the Great Elder in front of
        the Heavenly Dao Ancient City?
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er's brows were tightly wrinkled.</p>
      <p>
        "Could it be the same as the secret back then, Gu Changge at that time
        was like this…"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was shocked and thought of this.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, the expression she looked at Gu Changge changed.</p>
      <p>
        Just now, she was still full of vigilance and confusion, confusion, and
        dazed, but now it was complicated, and she was relieved to find the
        truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The immortal bone from the second nirvana, it almost became a disaster
        when I left you alone, but I didn't expect you to give a surprise to my
        brother."
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Changge seemed to see through Gu Xian'er's
        intentions, and a terrifying and unusual sword light broke through the
        air between his fingers, and hummed the sword ball in his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, he walked towards Gu Xian'er with an unusually
        indifferent expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er didn't expect Gu Changge to react so quickly in such a state,
        and he noticed it the first time she took out the forbidden weapon and
        destroyed it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        With a wave of her small hand, she brought out a blue-black umbrella,
        which was extremely huge. It unfolded between the heavens and the earth,
        a radiance fell and tried to suppress Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>This was also a very powerful treasure.</p>
      <p>
        However, with the flick of Gu Changge, the terrifying divine chain of
        laws emerged through the void. This powerful secret treasure was torn
        apart in an instant and could not resist at all.
      </p>
      <p>"How come, this guy is actually strong to this extent…"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er's face turned pale. With her current strength, using a divine
        artifact consumed a lot of energy, and using two pieces in a row already
        caused a lot of consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, in front of Gu Changge, it was impossible to even block
        him.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking of this, Gu Xian'er made up her mind.</p>
      <p>
        At this time, for the sake of Gu Changge and herself, she couldn't
        hesitate any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        She planned to sacrifice the secret treasure bestowed by a master in
        Peach Village.
      </p>
      <p>The power of that secret treasure was unparalleled…</p>
      <p>However, he seemed to know what Gu Xian'er was thinking.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's movements were faster than hers, especially at this moment,
        the void seemed to collapse, with a terrifying stagnation feeling.
      </p>
      <p>It was like a huge boulder of billions of miles had been crushed!</p>
      <p>She couldn't move for a moment.</p>
      <p>And couldn't even lift a finger.</p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!</strong></p>
      <p>The void trembled, and Gu Changge walked slowly.</p>
      <p>
        He quickly raised his palm, reached over in an instant, grabbed her
        neck, and lifted it up.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>

      </div>
      <p>Gu Xian'er's face turned pale, and she was a little breathless.</p>
      <p>
        Her newly born immortal bone had undergone a second transformation, and
        it contained a terrifying power that could make people palpitate.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of power was extremely tyrannical, even a bit like the power
        of the legendary flying immortal, but it was the ultimate attack type
        supernatural power.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, under the terrifying suppression of Gu Changge, this immortal
        bone of hers did not wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if it leaked a trace of aura, it was wiped off by Gu Changge, and
        it was impossible for it to play a role at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's stupid and pitiful. After so long, what means do you have that I
        don't know?"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge spoke indifferently, with an indifferent mockery.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er's face was pale, and she remembered the feeling of despair
        and powerlessness when she was a child.
      </p>
      <p>Cold and darkness swept through her consciousness.</p>
      <p>
        Against Gu Changge, let alone resist, she didn't even have a chance to
        speak.
      </p>
      <p>The gap was really too big.</p>
      <p>
        No matter how much she cultivated during this time, in fact, she
        couldn't catch up with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>He was so powerful that he could easily kill herself.</p>
      <p>
        In particular, Gu Changge also clearly knew her trump card, and the
        divine weapons and secret treasures given by the masters.
      </p>
      <p>She didn't even have a chance to use it.</p>
      <p>"Am I going to die here today? At the hands of Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>
        In a trance, Gu Xian'er's consciousness became cold, and she murmured in
        her heart as she fell into darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        She suddenly remembered the slender and tall figure standing in front of
        her when Gu Changge appeared in the Ancient Immortal Continent and in
        front of the Heavenly Dao Ancient City.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed like he could block all of her enemies. VIssịT
        n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
      </p>
      <p>That feeling made her nostalgic.</p>
      <p>
        "No wonder he wanted me to practice hard, so that I can one day be
        strong enough to defeat him…"
      </p>
      <p>
        "All his previous goals were actually for today… To let me have a better
        chance of surviving in front of him."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er had figured it out.</p>
      <p>
        Earlier, why did Gu Changge force her to practice by various means, even
        at the cost of offending the Great Elder, to force him to teach her a
        good life.
      </p>
      <p>It was because he knew that one day… he would attack herself!</p>
      <p>"Your brother will accept this new immortal bone with a smile."</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge said lightly, and seemed indifferent to Gu Xian'er's state at
        the moment.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er looked at him, but her expression was surprisingly calm.</p>
      <p>
        She didn't even complain about Gu Changge, she knew that he was in a
        very strange state now, the kind of aura that oozed from his bones, made
        her tremble.
      </p>
      <p>"This immortal bone, if you want it, take it."</p>
      <p>
        She was talking to herself, thinking that she couldn't break free. It
        wasn't unacceptable to die in Gu Changge's hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just a pity… She still had a lot of things she wanted to do that
        she hadn't done. The whereabouts of her parents and grandfather were
        unknown and had not yet been found.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Hum!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge raised his palm, and the other palm seemed to become a
        peerless immortal sword, the sword intent filled with brilliance, he
        wanted to pierce through Gu Xian'er's body and dig out her immortal
        bone.
      </p>
      <p>But in the next moment.</p>
      <p>
        A violent aura suddenly appeared on Gu Changge's face, as if an
        unparalleled devil wanted to slaughter the heavens!
      </p>
      <p>"Get lost!"</p>
      <p>
        He was roaring, his voice was low, with a meaning of struggle and
        coldness, which manifested on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hand that was about to tear Gu Xian'er apart suddenly stopped in
        mid-air, while trembling constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed to be fighting against another unknown and inexplicable
        terrorist force.
      </p>
      <p>His expression remained indifferent.</p>
      <p>
        But there existed more emotions such as anger, coldness, and violence.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>"What's wrong with you?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was stunned, but was suddenly released by Gu Changge and fell
        to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>She widened her eyes, thinking she was going to die just now.</p>
      <p>
        But she didn't expect that at a critical moment, Gu Changge would let
        her go? He did not continue to attack her.
      </p>
      <p>How was this happening?</p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">

          });

      </div>
      <p>
        Another force was controlling his body and consciousness? And his
        original consciousness was fighting to regain control of his body?
      </p>
      <p>Soon, Gu Xian'er reacted.</p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, how to explain Gu Changge's amazing magical nature and what
        he was doing now.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, what’s wrong with you? How can I help you?"</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er couldn't help but feel a little anxious, her concern and
        worry were beyond words.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she was not worried about her own safety, but felt that Gu
        Changge needed help, and he had a big problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, judging from his actions just now, all this was
        involuntarily, he was not under his own control.
      </p>
      <p>He had absolutely no intention of doing it.</p>
      <p>
        "Go away, I told you to go away, don't you understand? Go as far as you
        want."
      </p>
      <p>Hearing this, Gu Changge suddenly looked up at her.</p>
      <p>
        His eyes were full of violent aura, and he roared in a low voice, as if
        he was struggling to control his body.
      </p>
      <p>
        His other hand was tightly grasping his right hand, and many of the
        talismans were so bright that even the void was affected, and it was
        about to collapse, revealing a dangerous atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed that he was about to attack Gu Xian'er, but he was caught
        tightly by the other hand, making it difficult to move.
      </p>
      <p>This was a very strange and incongruous scene.</p>
      <p>But Gu Xian'er understood.</p>
      <p>
        That hand was now out of Gu Changge's control, and he seemed to be
        almost unable to suppress that terrifying power.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'm not leaving, I can help you. What should I do, can I help you after
        this immortal bone is dug out?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er asked anxiously, it was not unreasonable for her to think so.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, judging from Gu Changge's actions just now, he had always
        wanted to dig out her own immortal bone, which meant that this immortal
        bone was very useful to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Go away, you're a piece of shit, what can you do for me? I don't need
        your immortal bone."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't want to kill you, so as not to contaminate my hand, Gu Xian'er,
        get out of here, as far as you can…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Gu Changge looked at her coldly, and became even more
        violent.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Gu Changge, don't deceive yourself, you are way too arrogant, it's
        already like this, you're still so proud, you still don't want to accept
        the kindness of others, don't accept the help of others…"
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er's voice trembled, she was about to cry at this time.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>But Gu Changge couldn't hear her words.</p>
      <p>
        An even more terrifying demonic energy instantly enveloped him, making
        him look even more indifferent and ruthless, without the many emotions
        he had just now.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's stupid to have to wait for your death if you don't want to live."
        He calmed down and said lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, he reached out with his big hand, and wanted to strike at Gu
        Xian'er again.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge, wake up, don't be occupied by demonic nature!"</p>
      <p>
        Seeing this, Gu Xian'er turned pale and shouted, trying to awaken Gu
        Changge's original consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, Gu Changge's current consciousness was once again occupied by
        demonic nature, and this was not what he was just now.
      </p>
      <p>"I am me, why should I wake up?" Gu Changge said lightly.</p>
      <p>Seeing that this palm was about to land on Gu Xian'er.</p>
      <p>
        In the next moment, his expression changed again, and it looked like he
        was schizophrenic.
      </p>
      <p>His voice was violent and cold, "Don't touch her."</p>
      <p>
        As the words fell, Gu Changge's expression was indifferent and decisive,
        and each rune suddenly disappeared.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Boom!</strong></p>
      <p>The entire arm suddenly exploded with a bang.</p>
      <p>As a result, Gu Changge's state seemed to be relieved.</p>
      <p>
        The terrifying aura also stagnated, and the demonic energy began to
        dissipate like a tide.
      </p>
      <p>
        He closed his eyes, his expression returned to calm, and he stood
        silently on the spot without any movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene made Gu Xian'er stunned, and then tears fell silently down
        her face.
      </p>
      <p>"Gu Changge…"</p>
      <p>
        She was crying. In her opinion, Gu Changge was fighting against the
        demonic nature in his body in order to protect her.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, how could he make such a move?</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er didn't see either, the peach blossom she hid under her
        sleeve, the glow on it suddenly disappeared, and it became dim.
      </p>
      <p>It was a vague phantom that could not be seen.</p>
      <p>
        If Gu Changge really wanted to kill her, the phantom on this peach
        blossom would definitely revive.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er didn't know about this at all.</p>

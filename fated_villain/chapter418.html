          Luoshen without giving her too much trouble. He had been ordering her
          around like a maid during this period but she was still the Princess
          of the Godly Illusion Clan and the future Godly Illusion Empress,
          which meant she had to go back eventually. </span

          never be trusted to follow them. Jun Bufan was an excellent example of

          reconnaissance for any information which the Nephrite Bronze Pavillion
          most lacks,&#8221; he replied carelessly. By now the Tang Family from
          the Alliance of Thousand Merchants should be almost entirely
          infiltrated, so it was time to let Yin Mei take charge of the
          Alliance. That way, most of the power would fall into her hands. As
          for Tang Wan, he did not trust her. She was merely a chess piece to
          trigger the misunderstanding between Chu Hao and Qin Wuya.</span

          >&#8220;Information?&#8221; Bai Lianer&#8217;s expression shifted.
          This was exactly what the Nephrite Bronze Pavillion most lacked. While
          she had been developing her spy network in recent years, it was still
          far too short a time compared to the millions of years any other
          forces had the chance to develop. The other assassin guilds such as
          the Pagoda and Neraka had already lasted for millions of years,
          spanning multiple millennia.</span

          >&#8220;If you plan on training apprentices, I have some suitable
          candidates.&#8221; Gu Changge continued. He held a lot of power at the
          surface level, but he didn&#8217;t really have much in terms of
          underground forces. He could take this opportunity to control the
          Nephrite Bronze Pavillion too.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She was somewhat attracted by that idea since the Killing Emperor
          Legacy had given her hope at the darkest time of her life. The former
          Killing Emperor had been a powerful expert who founded the famous
          Killing Dao Holy Land but for multiple reasons, it had fallen apart.
          Thus, she wished to fulfil the dying wish of the Killing Emperor and
          rebuild the top Killing Dao force in the world. The founding of the
          Nephrite Bronze Pavillion was mostly because of the Killing Emperor
          Legacy too.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I have no problem with that, but it depends on whether you are
          sincere or not.&#8221; She was extremely wary of him since this was
          someone who would betray his subordinates if they weren&#8217;t alert
          or sufficiently useful.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge merely smiled without saying anything. He knew that she
          would agree to it. He had many things on his plate right now and he
          could only let her deal with the Nephrite Bronze Pavillion. Many
          things had transpired in the Upper Realm, which he already knew of
          despite being in the Demon Realm because of his spies. He didn&#8217;t
          plan on heading to the Immortal Academy for now, since he didn&#8217;t
          have to go there anymore with his current strength.</span

          >[Chaos has ensued in the Demon-Burying Abyss, exuding high levels of
          Demonic Qi which nearly destroyed the Floating Buddha Temple. Many
          monks of Buddhist Mountain had gone there but ended up dying inside. A
          great demon is awakening inside the Abyss, which caused a catastrophe.
          Even an enlightened Buddha nearly died inside. Seems like you are
          finally awakening, my good apprentice.]</span

          sleeve at the foot of a green mountain. He had been preparing for this

          would not be able to quell it. It was obvious she wanted to consume
          him after tearing him apart and crushing his bones to powder. Thus,
          this was an extremely complex problem. Nonetheless, he still had some
          ideas on how to resolve this since that was his apprentice from when
          he had been the Demon Lord. They were bound to have things in common
          that might be an ace to help him resolve this issue.</span

          >After returning to the Gu Family residence, he ordered his servants
          to release Bai Kun. He no longer wanted to trouble him since he had a
          promise to fulfil and besides, Bai Kun wasn&#8217;t worth the time.
          Furthermore, this was an easy act to pull off since it only needed an
          order.</span

          at their reunion. She did not elaborate on what happened in the Demon
          World and Bai Kun tactfully did not ask any further. Surviving was
          something he wouldn&#8217;t have dared believed and so he didn&#8217;t

          millennia. Her black hair was like a waterfall, while her entire body
          exuded an ethereal and otherworldly beauty which was indescribable yet
          cold. Her perfect skin was like flawless jade with a gorgeous glow as
          well. At closer observation, her features weren&#8217;t so distinct as
          if shrouded by mist, except for her cold and wise eyes which seemed to

          before Gu Qingyi, a white light flashed across her body as she
          transformed into a silver-haired girl who reached halfway below Gu
          Changge&#8217;s waist. Her features were delicate and fine, with thin
          eyebrows, a small elegant nose, and light crimson-coloured eyes like
          amber. Her skin was like porcelain and her golden veins were visible.
          Her entire being exuded a regal and cold air.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While Gu Changge studied her, she did not cower like before, choosing
          to bare her small and slightly sharp teeth at him in a show of
          ferociousness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m your master.&#8221; Gu Changge did not get annoyed
          but remained relaxed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Sister Qingyi.&#8221; She snorted and refused to look at him.
          However, he moved in front of Gu Qingyi to get close to the girl. Her
          voice was melodic and sounded as cold as jade, just a little like Gu
          Qingyi.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t think I will forget the way you frolicked when you
          act like this,&#8221; he said directly to her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The silver-haired girl gritted her teeth, a faint flush on her cheeks
          as she sounded frantic. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t! I was just being
          happy.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221; Gu Changge asked.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Why not?&#8221; She glared at him. &#8220;Do you think you can
          use that to describe a girl?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You are merely my pet. Why do you have so many girl
          problems?&#8221; He shook his head, still looking laid-back.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;How dare you! I&#8217;m the great celestial beast, Wang
          Yue!&#8221; She sounded irritated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;re still my pet, though. I&#8217;m your
          master,&#8221; he said carelessly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a master like you.&#8221; She still had
          many complaints about him. He had persuaded her back at the Purple
          Mountains with elaborate lies and promises but then abandoned her
          here. She was a weak, lonely, and helpless Wang Yue cub who had a
          great appetite. How could he be so cruel by abandoning her without a
          word? Besides, he gave her an ugly name too!</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Qingyi watched them quarrel, stroking the hair on her shoulder
          silently.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You visited me for a purpose, right?&#8221; she finally asked.
          She knew Gu Changge well since this man would never do anything
          without a reason.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing big. I just want a favour from you.&#8221;
          He smiled. He hadn&#8217;t mentioned anything before this because he
          was waiting for her to ask first.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What&#8217;s that favour?&#8221; she asked.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I want you to go to the Demon-Burying Abyss to check on the
          seal there.&#8221; He observed her reaction as he spoke, yet she
          didn&#8217;t show any emotion other than slight shock. This
          disappointed him somewhat.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Okay.&#8221; She nodded. She had never refused a request for
          him before and wasn&#8217;t going to do that now.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving, then. Oh, yes. I found some interesting
          trinkets when I went to the Demon World. You&#8217;ve probably never
          seen them since you&#8217;ve always stayed here.&#8221; Gu Changge got
          up to leave, but not before he pulled out myriad trinkets. These were
          tassels, hanging belt ornaments, hair combs, face powder, and rouge
          which were unique to the Demon World. They weren&#8217;t actually rare
          and precious; however, they could only be found in the Demon World
          since their materials were sourced from it and couldn&#8217;t grow
          anywhere else.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Mmm.&#8221; Gu Qingyi watched him disappear before looking at
          the trinkets laid before her and picking up a wooden comb. She
          wouldn&#8217;t leave this place except to cultivate, so she
          wouldn&#8217;t be acquainted with anything from the outside world. In
          that sense, she resembled a deity which isolated itself from the
          mortal world. Thus, Gu Changge would always bring her some trinkets
          from time to time. She wasn&#8217;t born a mortal, so she didn&#8217;t
          have the habit of acquainting herself with the world of mortals.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After leaving the world, Gu Changge went directly to the main palace
          to see his father. Gu Lingtian sat on the throne, his energy was
          powerful and all-encompassing. His will dominated the entire
          space.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You&#8217;re back.&#8221; Gu Lingtian opened his eyes, a
          gentle expression on his face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Father.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded. &#8221; I want to know what
          happened in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Upper Realm hadn&#8217;t been calm lately, which Gu Changge
          already knew about in the Demon World. In a nutshell, the Boundary
          Marker Sea outside the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were showing
          signs of drying up, where the All-Repelling Force it contained was
          slowly weakening. Many forces had made their move and started to send
          master cultivators to invade the area. The event had a wide impact,
          affecting every family and sect in the Upper Realm.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains was a realm similar to the Upper
          Realm in the sense that it was enormous and extremely old. The
          difference was that the former had lost in the great war between the
          two sides many millennia ago and had to retreat, leaving behind many
          territories. Some supremely powerful beings had worked together to set
          up the Boundary Marker Sea which contained the All-Repelling Force,
          making it difficult for even True Daoists to cross. This made the
          Boundary Marker Sea a natural barrier which had protected the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains for many years.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The two sides had had some quarrels in the past which resulted in
          some casualties, but the Upper Realm held the upper hand for the most
          part. The name itself—Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains—showed that the
          environment was inferior to the Upper Realm due to the incompleteness
          of the World Principles, at least compared to the latter. The
          consequences were that any extremely powerful being, even after
          reaching the Nirvana Realm, couldn&#8217;t live for an infinitely long
          time and thus had a shorter lifespan than those who cultivated here.
          The environment for cultivation there was much more difficult as well,
          which made it hard for master cultivators to be produced.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the two worlds had been born together, making their nature,
          Principles, social system, and races very similar. Some in the Upper
          Realm even believe that they could break the curse of not being able
          to become Immortals by combining the two worlds. They believe it might
          cause the Immortal Path to reappear. The drying up of the Boundary
          Marker Sea was the best opportunity for the Upper Realm to do so, even
          if they had to defend themselves against the Eternal Overcast Scourge
          at the same time.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Lingtian wasn&#8217;t surprised by this question. &#8220;The
          Boundary Marker Sea showed signs of drying up some time ago, which was
          reported by the factions standing guard at the border. This shocked
          everyone and many forces began gathering an army to invade.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Many have already declared war and sent their military forces,
          including the Immortal Academy, Sky Emperor Mountain, Mortal Palace,
          Immortal Wang Family, Ancient Ye Family, and the Supreme Cave Heaven,
          who had sent their special forces. Some young prodigies even went
          there so they could join in the invasion. This is an unavoidable
          situation which we can take advantage of.&#8221;</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge nodded thoughtfully. Many events were happening
          simultaneously, including the chaos at the Demon-Burying Abyss and the
          Eternal Overcast Scourge which weren&#8217;t even minor issues. But
          now, the Boundary Marker Sea was drying up and every single force was
          gathering to invade the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span

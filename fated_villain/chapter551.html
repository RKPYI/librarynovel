          storm brewed in his heart. If it turned out that the two individuals
          were actually the same person, then everything was simply too
          terrifying and unimaginable to him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Young War Immortal, being wise, decided to let sleeping dogs lie.
          He composed himself and offered a courteous smile while respectfully
          cupping his fist. “Thank you for your concern, Young Master Changge.
          Unfortunately, it appears that my injury from before has not fully
          healed yet…”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The conversation between the two puzzled those who heard them. Elders
          furrowed their brows, appearing slightly perplexed. The Young War
          Immortal’s words were quite vague, akin to a riddle that was not as
          straightforward as it seemed. Little did they know that this actually
          had a connection to the Successor of Demonic Arts who had previously
          attacked the Young War Immortal.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Curious looks appeared on the faces of the Phoenix Lady, Chosen Monk
          Jin Chan, and the others as they wondered if the Young War Immortal
          had something to do with Gu Changge. If that were true, then it would
          have been during the time when the Young War Immortal was still in the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then again, Gu Changge was busy dealing with the supreme experts
          there back then. It was unlikely he had the opportunity to interact
          with the Young War Immortal. Therefore, any resentment between the two
          would likely be related to the previous War Immortal of the War
          Immortal Manor.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, Gu Changge was believed to have killed the previous War
          Immortal in the Heavenly Tide Realm, which fueled War Immortal Manor’s
          animosity toward him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When the Young War Immortal was attacked by the Successor of Demonic
          Arts, Gu Changge was still in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
          Therefore, they did not consider the possibility of any connection
          between the two incidents, as they seemed completely unrelated.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The commotion quickly died down, and the Sect Masters resumed their
          study of the Intangible Demonic Rock. Gu Changge led Gu Xianer, Su
          Qingge, Ah Da, and the others to explore other areas.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The market street was exceptionally broad, almost like a world of its
          own. Each divine rock was carefully placed at a distance from one
          another to prevent their aura from interfering with each other.</span

          >“Qingxuan, the Young War Immortal seemed to be staring at you just
          now. Have you met him before?” Gu Changge smiled and casually asked Su
          Qingge, who was walking beside him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge felt a squeeze in her heart. In fact, she had this sinking
          feeling that things had unexpectedly gone wrong when the Young War
          Immortal noticed her earlier. Although she made sure to hide her face
          back then, the Young War Immortal seemed to possess some kind of
          special eye technique. It was very likely that he already knew her
          identity, otherwise he wouldn&#8217;t have been so surprised.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge was determined to keep her secrets. She shook her head and
          replied, “Qingxuan has never met the Young War Immortal before, Young
          Master Gu. I have no idea why he was staring at me.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When Gu Changge heard her, he gave her a small smile though his
          expression remained largely unchanged. “He must be a skirt-chaser,
          then.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge steeled herself and said, “Who knows, maybe he thought I
          was someone else.”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge’s response seemed like a gracious way of not pursuing the
          matter, but even so this made her situation more difficult. She was
          starting to feel that the challenge to keep her identity as the
          Successor of Demonic Arts hidden. This made her a little panic, as she
          was unsure of what to do next. [Is confessing to him the only option I
          have left? Will he kill me as soon as he finds out?]</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Well, there are indeed countless ways to change one’s
          appearance in this world. Maybe he really mistook you for someone
          else.” Gu Changge nodded in agreement.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Su Qingge couldn&#8217;t help but feel that there was more to Gu
          Changge&#8217;s words than what he was saying. It was almost like he
          was thinking up an excuse for her. She felt a little relieved, but it
          seemed like the only solution to this was to eliminate the Young War
          Immortal.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her biggest concern now was whether the Young War Immortal would
          disclose her true identity to the Forces behind him now that he had
          found out about it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Meanwhile, a group of people from the An family were investigating
          some rocks on the other side. An Xi looked at the Young War Immortal
          curiously and asked, “Are you alright?”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Young War Immortal had already calmed down by now. He shook his
          head, giving her the same excuse he had used before. “I was just lost
          in thought, there’s nothing to worry about.”</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >While saying that, he fixed his gaze on Gu Changge’s distant back and
          furrowed his brow.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If Gu Changge’s servant was really the Successor of Demonic Arts, who
          attacked him back then, then it was likely that Gu Changge didn’t know
          about it. He probably also didn’t know that she was the enigmatic
          Successor of Demonic Arts.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >There was also a possibility that Gu Changge was actually aware of
          this, but chose to silently consent and turn a blind eye to it. That
          could be why the Successor of Demonic Arts was able to escape from him
          again and again.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >During their previous encounter, the Young War Immortal came to
          realize that the Successor of Demonic Arts was indeed strong, but not
          powerful enough to easily kill him. Otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t have
          been able to escape by chance. This certainly contradicted the
          previous rumors that suggested only Gu Changge could suppress the
          Successor of Demonic Arts.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          reason why a weak Successor of Demonic Arts like her could repeatedly
          escape from Gu Changge. It was because he was allowing it to
          happen.</span

          Conference is over, otherwise something horrible will definitely take
          place. How terrifying…] The Young War Immortal trembled slightly as he
          found both possibilities to be equally concerning. For now, he
          refrained from confiding in anyone about this. He feared that doing so
          would further complicate the situation, putting him in serious danger
          and even prevent him from leaving Dark Kun City.</span

          previously extracted many treasures from such rocks with his ability.
          Now that he was going to demonstrate his skills again, the area
          quickly became congested. Many prominent figures in the city also
          hurried over to witness the spectacle. Even the beautiful Princess Yu
          Feiya was here, carefully observing Jiang Chen’s skill.</span

          assistance to the prominent figures from the Upper Realm that were
          gathered here, they could effortlessly gain their favour. This was a

          However, Xiao Ruoyin believed he would come around if she clarified it
          to him. After all, who in the entire Upper Realm wouldn&#8217;t be

          quite the feud with this Young Master Gu you speak of. So your efforts
          will only be in vain,&#8221; the young man replied, baffling Xiao

          flashed across his eyes, and he suddenly called out, &#8220;Please
          hold on. I wish to speak to you in private if you don&#8217;t mind. It
          will only take a moment.&#8221;</span

          >Xiao Ruoyin furrowed her brows but wasn&#8217;t worried that Jiang
          Chen would do her any harm. Thus, she told her fellow disciples to
          wait for her outside after some thinking and turned to Jiang Chen.
          &#8220;You can say whatever it is you want to tell me
          here.&#8221;</span

          layer of hazy glow to brush past him before the bones in his body
          cracked one after another. His body transformed visibly, and in two
          trembles, he became a whole different person.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin was somewhat shocked and baffled by his actions. That was

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          from her past world who came to this world with her. To be able to
          bump into him in Dark Kun City delighted her.</span

          wonder I thought you felt familiar.&#8221; Xiao Ruoyin beamed, and she
          instantly figured out why he would voluntarily give her the Blood King
          Ginseng back in the stone-gambling hall.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, before Jiang Chen could say anything, a thought struck her,
          and she couldn&#8217;t help asking, &#8220;By the way, how did you end
          up becoming a Divine Source Master? Were you fated with a different
          Destiny? But I remember the test indicated that you guys didn&#8217;t
          have any amplitude to cultivate. Young Master Gu told me he had sorted
          you guys out, so I was relieved. But why wouldn&#8217;t you work for
          him and even say you two have some sort of feud?&#8221;

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          >&#8220;Gu Changge had lied to you back then. He was already scheming
          back when he released us. The stones used to test our amplitude were
          rigged by him in secret. Hence, none of our amplitude other than yours
          could be detected. That way, he can throw us out with a justifiable
          reason while reassuring you. Gu Changge has just put on a benign
          facade… The real Gu Changge is far cruller and more heartless than
          anyone in this world…&#8221; said Jiang Chen unhurriedly, recounting
          all that had happened one by one, from how Gu Changge ordered his men
          to annihilate them after they separated from Xiao Ruoyin to all that
          had happened inside the Godly Illusion Tomb. He related everything in
          detail.</span

          stumped when she heard Jiang Chen&#8217;s story, then she jolted and

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She had been cultivating in Skyward Schloss all this while and would
          hear many things about Gu Changge from many fellow disciples and
          Elders. Hence, her impression of the man had always been warm,
          gentlemanly, unadulterated, even celestial-like. When she interacted
          with Gu Changge, all was well. But now, after hearing Jiang
          Chen&#8217;s version of Gu Changge, she was dumbfounded, and her face
          even turned pale.</span

          Gu Changge!? Is how he behaves in front of me just the tip of the
          iceberg? Is it all just a facade?] Xiao Ruoyin couldn&#8217;t help
          shuddering in fear as she realised she seemed to have pictured Gu
          Changge being far too innocent of a man.</span

          lie to you? Our friends, including Niu Tian. Who knows if

          that she couldn&#8217;t pick out a single flaw. If she hadn&#8217;t

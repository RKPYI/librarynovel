          sudden shout. None of the seated leaders had expected someone to stand
          up and say something like this to Gu Changge. This surprised them so
          much that their heads turned to look at Xiao Yang in unison. Even the
          Supreme Mountain Elder beside him frowned slightly as he thought Xiao
          Yang was being too impulsive.</span

          >Many people grew alarmed when they began to recognise Xiao Yang.
          &#8220;It&#8217;s the disciple from the Nine Great Mountains. I heard
          that he is also the last disciple of the Nine Great Mountains&#8217;
          Second Mountain Elder. The man in the golden robe beside him is Gu
          Wudi, the Chosen One from the Nine Great Mountains. Is he trying to
          get himself killed? Why is he saying something like this
          now?&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A majority of the crowd was a little dissatisfied. They were worried
          that Xiao Yang would upset Gu Changge with his behaviour. Now that
          they were in the same boat, Xiao Yang&#8217;s identity wouldn&#8217;t
          stop them from holding him accountable if he ended up affecting the
          outcome of the situation.</span

          he care. He let out a small smile and hummed, &#8220;You want to see
          your Master and sister, you say? Sure. I&#8217;ll take the chance to
          show everyone my sincerity.&#8221;</span

          outside the sanctum. Everyone couldn&#8217;t help looking over, their
          pupils dilating slightly.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The leader of the group was the Second Mountain Elder of the Nine
          Great Mountains, whose expression looked conflicted. Even though he
          hadn&#8217;t been tormented, he couldn&#8217;t use his cultivation, as
          it was still sealed.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Changge did not let him come out, for now.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone in the hall was shocked by the sight. When they came back to
          their senses, they carefully looked at the Second Mountain Elder and
          Luo Ying, and they let out sighs of relief when they found the duo
          unharmed. This must be what Gu Changge meant by him showing his
          sincerity—he didn&#8217;t harm his hostages.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >This suddenly gave them hope. They might still have a chance of
          surviving at this trap of a meeting, contrary to their expectations.
          If Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t plotting something bigger, he might really
          intend to talk of a truce.</span

          >&#8220;Master… Ying…&#8221; Xiao Yang uttered, his eyes suddenly
          turning red when he saw the Second Mountain Elder and Luo Ying. Blood
          was thicker than water. Even though he had never met Luo Ying before,
          his instincts told him that this was his blood related sister.</span

          expect that there would be a day when he would see his apprentice
          again. His expression was even more complicated. There were more
          traces of helplessness and regret than relief on his face. He could
          tell how much Xiao Yang had matured and grown out of his rash self in
          the past.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Luo Ying stared at Xiao Yang. &#8220;Yang…&#8221; She, too, was
          trembling as her eyes reddened. Xiao Yang would be her remaining
          relative in this world if everything had happened as she thought it
          would.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge kept smiling. &#8220;I am a man of my word. I have no
          problem letting them go if the truce is successfully
          established.&#8221; However, he didn&#8217;t give them a chance to
          reminisce as he waved, and his subordinates beside Luo Ying and the
          Second Mountain Elder quickly brought them away.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >No one in the sanctum dared to say anything to stop him despite
          seeing this. Xiao Yang, on the other hand, could barely hide his
          hatred for Gu Changge as a fire burned in his eyes. There were light
          green runes surging on his body, and his aura seemed to be evolving
          into an unknown state.

          >The Supreme Mountain Elder frowned when he saw this. &#8220;Be quiet,
          Xiao Yang!&#8221; he roared. Displeased with Xiao Yang, the rest from
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains also had their eyebrows pulled
          together. If it weren&#8217;t for them holding themselves back in the
          presence of the Supreme Mountain Elder, many would have wanted to shut
          Xiao Yang up themselves. How could a Junior like him kick up a fuss
          when they, the real ruler of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains,
          hadn&#8217;t even spoken yet?</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Please stop, Junior Xiao Yang.&#8221; This time, it was Gu
          Wudi beside Xiao Yang who sighed and tugged on Xiao Yang before he
          explained under his breath, &#8220;Gu Changge has promised to let the
          Second Mountain Elder and Junior Luo Ying go if the discussion on this
          truce goes smoothly. He will not go back on his words. You&#8217;ll
          only make matters worse if you keep going.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although Xiao Yang also knew this, he couldn&#8217;t come to terms
          with it, especially after seeing his Master and sister with his own
          eyes. How he wished he could save them and take them away right
          now.</span

          >Gu Changge was not at all concerned about Xiao Yang, who was on edge.
          To him, Xiao Yang was no different from a dead person. It didn&#8217;t
          bother him one bit to let Xiao Yang ‘bark’ for a bit.</span

          >&#8220;Young Master Changge, what exactly is the truce you have
          mentioned?&#8221; In the eyes of many, Xiao Yang&#8217;s incident was
          just an episode that was not worth mentioning. They only cared about
          the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains&#8217; survival. At this moment,
          the Crimson Shack Domain Ruler stood up. Dressed in a fiery red robe,
          and even having red hair, he looked like the God of Flames. He exuded
          an unrivalled aura like a burning fire. His words were also the focus
          of everyone&#8217;s attention as they all looked over immediately upon
          hearing his words.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge continued to unhurriedly sip on his wine as he stayed
          seated in the main seat. When he heard this Domain Ruler, he put down
          his cup and smiled. &#8220;It&#8217;s as the name suggests. I hope to
          restore peace to both realms and for there to be fewer
          killings.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many people felt their hearts tremble when he said those words. Even
          though they found it hard to believe, they couldn&#8217;t help feeling
          some hope. Restoring peace was the one thing they wanted more than
          anything. &#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Definitely. I swear on my Dao Heart. Of course, it&#8217;s on
          the premise of how the truce will turn out,&#8221; he smilingly
          hinted.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You swear on your Dao Heart? Please carefully consider your
          words, Young Master Changge.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone present was no stranger to such Oaths, which could be said
          to be one of the most severe of Oaths for cultivators. No one would
          dare to violate such an oath unless they did not want to breakthrough
          their cultivation later in life or were corrupted by heart demons. For
          these reasons, they believed Gu Changge&#8217;s words. They even felt
          that this meeting did not seem to be as deadly as they thought.</span

          >&#8220;It seems that you are all clever men and women. Look how well
          the conversation went!&#8221; Gu Changge nodded slightly with a smile
          on his face. He then added unhurriedly, &#8220;Actually, this truce
          I&#8217;ll be suggesting is simple. From today onwards, the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains will be attached to the Upper Realm like
          the Lower Realm. Other than acting according to the will of the Upper
          Realm, you have to provide a certain amount of resources and other
          things every year&#8230;&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, the looks on everyone&#8217;s faces had already changed
          before he finished speaking. Many of them stood up all of a sudden,
          their expressions immediately turned sullen.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Don&#8217;t push it, Gu Changge! What is the difference
          between doing this and surrendering and becoming slaves to the Upper
          Realm? You speak of bringing peace, but what you call peace is clearly
          turning all of us to slaves! Do forgive us for not agreeing to
          it.&#8221; Several Domain Rulers stood up in unison with sour looks on
          their faces, and they expressed their anger immediately.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They had some expectations at first, but they finally understood now
          that they heard Gu Changge&#8217;s words. His &#8216;truce&#8217; was
          only a guise to hide the fact that it was a slave contract.</span

          Realm&#8217;s command and surrendering to the Upper Realm?&#8221; The
          faces of the leaders of the other clans were also extremely gloomy.
          They thought that Gu Changge was going overboard. [He made us think
          that he&#8217;s merciful enough to let the Eight Wastelands and Ten
          Domains off the hook. In the end, it turns out it was all a ploy to
          trick everyone here so that he can deal with us all at once.]</span

          &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like you appreciate my
          offer.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The moment he uttered those words, the unadulterated killing intent
          sent a chill up the crowd&#8217;s back. [Are we all going to die
          here?]</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Supreme Mountain Elder frowned again, and he couldn&#8217;t help
          but ask, &#8220;Is there no room for compromise?&#8221;

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >For him, this truce wasn&#8217;t that important. All he wanted was to
          save Luo Feng. The fate of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains had
          nothing to do with him anyway. However, it would be troublesome for
          him to have to spend time on finding Luo Feng, as Gu Changge
          hadn&#8217;t let him make an appearance yet. The best thing the
          Supreme Mountain Elder could do now was to drag this conversation
          on.</span

          die.&#8221; The smile on Gu Changge&#8217;s face fell and turned
          indifferent. He then stood up, and with a wave of his hand as his
          words fell, there was a sudden vast and terrifying fluctuation outside
          the sanctum, like God had come to crush this place. The pressure
          didn&#8217;t stop at just one wave.</span

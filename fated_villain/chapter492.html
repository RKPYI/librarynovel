          waves. Even heaven and earth nearly overturned under such an erratic

          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains so many years later,&#8221; sighed an
          incredibly blurry figure with bloody eyes. He stood on a golden path
          that stretched from the depths of the universe. His eyes contained
          great contempt as many terrifying visions appeared behind him. He was
          a True Daoist from the Upper Realm with immensely deep
          cultivation.</span

          in their true bodies, unlike before. Behind them were several even

          Asked an ancient being hidden in a red glow while looking
          enigmatically at the Sky Deer Goddess, who stood silently at the far
          back.</span

          crossed paths with the Sky Deer Goddess in the past. In fact, she had
          killed one of their supreme experts. It could be said that the two had
          an irreconcilable feud. However, he dared not insult the Sky Deer
          Goddess when the latter was now Gu Changgeâ€™s concubine.</span

          witness the downfall of the city?</span

          over. It was already a surprise to them that the Sky Deer Goddess
          would yield to the Upper Realm, let alone as Gu Changge&#8217;s
          concubine. As hard as it was to believe the news, they had a feeling
          the Sky Deer Goddess had made a pact with Gu Changge after mulling
          over it.</span

          Realm. It will eventually fall,&#8221; commented the Sky Deer Goddess
          impassively as she glanced at the supreme expert from the Ancient
          Royal Family and the other supreme experts.</span

          >&#8220;Oh? Sounds to me that you decided to surrender to us in
          advance because you knew it would come to this. You&#8217;re a smart
          one; I&#8217;ll give you that,&#8221; said the supreme expert as he
          smiled in revelation, clearly ridiculing the Goddess for being a
          coward and choosing to side with the Upper Realm after knowing the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains would eventually fall.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Those around were Ancestral level figures from various forces with
          fearsome authority. Of course, they caught the supreme expert&#8217;s
          implication, but none said anything. After all, the Sky Deer Goddess
          was from the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, a different realm from
          theirs. There would inevitably be a gap between them.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Sky Deer Goddess, on the other hand, frowned. She didn&#8217;t
          want to cause unnecessary trouble, but the supreme expert was
          evidently bitter about the incident from the past, as his words were
          filled with ill-concealed malice and ridicule. However, just as the
          Goddess was about to refute, Gu Changge, who stood beside her, raised
          his hand, signalling to her it was unnecessary.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You seemed to have gotten one thing wrong, Senior. She
          hadn&#8217;t yielded to the Upper Realm but to me,&#8221; said Gu
          Changge with a slight smile as he glanced at the True Daoist.
          &#8220;So that makes her mine. If it&#8217;s still unclear to you, I
          don&#8217;t mind helping you sear the notion into your
          mind.&#8221;</span

          turned slightly unpleasant while their hearts skipped a beat as they
          sensed the unexplainable intimidation.</span

          >Meanwhile, the supreme expert who had spoken up eventually remained
          silent, even though a storm brewed beneath his eyes, and he felt
          somewhat indignant, he chose to relent. He didn&#8217;t want to cross
          Gu Changge when the final battle was just ahead of them. Besides, the
          man had made it clear that the Sky Deer Goddess was his. Hence, only
          death would await him if he dared lay a finger on the woman. More
          importantly, there were rumours that the Gu Family&#8217;s Ancestor,
          who had annihilated Purple Mansion, had arrived. He just hadn&#8217;t
          shown himself, and it worried the supreme expert.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After all, the Great Elder of Purple Mansion was one of the best
          there was. In fact, some believed he would have long advanced into the
          Immortal Realm if heaven allowed it. However, the mighty Great Elder
          of Purple Mansion eventually died from one attack from the Gu Family
          Ancestor.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          seriously, never daring to fool around with his own life.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          Changge, for she, too, was surprised that Gu Changge would stand up
          for her at this time. An indescribably peculiar feeling arose within
          her.</span

          provoking him.]</span

          was mostly saying it to the other True Daoists present, she still
          couldn&#8217;t help feeling touched. To the outside world, she was Gu
          Changge&#8217;s concubine, which in turn, made her a member of the Gu
          Family, and even though Gu Changge made nothing of this role, it still
          had to do with the Gu Family&#8217;s pride and dignity.</span

          all, the city can&#8217;t take much of the Upper Realm&#8217;s
          attacks. Once the city is breached, we&#8217;ll all be slaughtered. Do
          you think the Goddess can bear witnessing such an end?&#8221; Lin Wu
          sighed. He had already told his clan about it, but his Elders made
          nothing of it and were too proud to yield to the Upper Realm. They
          prided themselves too much as the Blood Dragon War Clan. If it
          weren&#8217;t that they were facing a great war, he would probably
          still be serving detention.</span

          Wastelands and Ten Domains were indeed once a part of the Upper Realm,
          but for some reason, it split off. And according to the records in
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, the Upper Realm had always played
          the role of invader while the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains kept
          resisting.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          the â€‹â€‹Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. The trillions of Lower Realms

          that reason was clearly invalid.</span

          >Gu Changge shook his head casually with an enigmatic gaze.
          &#8220;Looks like you don&#8217;t know. In forgotten times, the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains actually used to be called the Barren
          Realm. It was a wasteland surrounded by void and stars. There was even
          a saying that the realm was a dedicated place to exile members of the
          Upper Realm who had committed terrible crimes that were not yet
          deserving of deathâ€¦ With time, the exiled settled down and formed
          their own families until the Upper Realm fell apart one day. An
          absolute being born from the Barren Realm used the chance to steal
          some of the Upper Realm&#8217;s Fortuity to nurture the Barren Realm.
          Because of this, no Upper Realm cultivator had been able to advance to
          the Immortal Realm for aeons. Of course, it&#8217;s only a legend the
          Upper Realm had recorded. I don&#8217;t know how valid it
          is.&#8221;</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A chuckle escaped Gu Changge towards the end of his words. Be it the
          Upper Realm or the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains; they ultimately
          had their own reasons and stances. However, at the end of the day,
          history was written down by the victor. They would inevitably beautify
          the story. Just like the many in this day and age who weren&#8217;t
          certain why the Upper Realm would constantly invade the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span

          Celestial Gate emerge and form the Celestial Path?&#8221; The Sky Deer
          Goddess suddenly felt glum, suddenly realising it wasn&#8217;t about
          who was right. Rather, each party just had different stances.</span

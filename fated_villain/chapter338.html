          suddenly pulled out a white bottle from his chest and handed it to
          her. &#8220;This is the water from the Lake of Reincarnation Qin Wuya
          spoke of. I took a look at it and there shouldn&#8217;t be a problem

          pondering about Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s situation, she did not accept the
          bottle right away. Rather, she peered at him and squinted her eyes.
          &#8220;So, memories from my past life will be reawakened after I drink

          >&#8220;Then, do you want me to drink it?&#8221; Gu Xianer raised her
          head and stared at him as indescribable emotions surged in her eyes.
          She didn&#8217;t know why she would ask him such a question out of
          nowhere, but she couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether she would turn
          into another person if her memories from her past life reawakened.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In response, Gu Changge chuckled aloud. &#8220;Why? Are you going to
          turn into another entity once you drink it? Or, will it grant you the
          power to beat me?&#8221;</span

          >&#8220;I am not talking about that. Don&#8217;t change the
          subject.&#8221; Gu Xianer furiously glared at him, knowing he was
          digressing from the subject on purpose.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You know, some decisions are yours to make yourself, since
          you&#8217;re the one who chose this. Besides, I believe you&#8217;re
          curious as to whether Qin Wuya and Sky King Zhi Yang were telling the
          truth.&#8221; Gu Changge withdrew his smile and revealed a rare stern
          expression, as if he was contemplating for her sake.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing that, Gu Xianer looked at him deeply. It was as Gu Changge
          had stated, she was eager to find out the validity of Sky King Zhi
          Yang&#8217;s words, and she wondered if reincarnation actually
          existed. Previously, she didn&#8217;t accept the water from the Lake
          of Reincarnation out of concern that the water might be dangerous, but
          now that Gu Changge assured her, it must mean that the water was
          fine.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After a moment of consideration, Gu Xianer pursed her lips and made
          up her mind. She finally accepted the little white bottle. However,
          the next moment, her actions were even more direct as she, without any
          hesitation, turned the bottle upside down and poured the water onto
          the ground.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Splash!* Along with the splash, a silver flow of vibrant light
          gushed out from the flask into the air. It was as if the Milky Way was
          plummeting. The water from the Lake of Reincarnation glowed
          dazzlingly, carrying wondrous runes, but the moment it was exposed to
          the air, it vanished without a trace, as if it was vaporised.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Seemingly surprised by that, Gu Changge painfully asked, &#8220;Did
          you have to pour it all out?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Coldly, Gu Xianer rolled her eyes at him. &#8220;So what? Did you
          really want me to drink it?&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What an idiot.&#8221; Gu Changge heaved a sigh. &#8220;If you
          weren&#8217;t going to drink it anyway, why didn&#8217;t you just
          return it to me? Water from the Lake of Reincarnation, wasted just
          like that. Jeez, Qin Wuya must have paid a great price to retrieve
          this small bottle.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you missing the point here? Are you seriously
          upset over some lake water?&#8221; Gu Xianer stared at him,
          disaffected. She thought this decision of hers would cause Gu Changge
          to have a new perception of her, and perhaps even be happy or
          comforted about it. That he would give her a compliment or two, but
          evidently, that wasn&#8217;t the case.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Is he genuinely heartbroken over this small bottle of water? Do I
          mean less than the water to him!?]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Looking at her praise-seeking expression, Gu Changge subconsciously
          laughed. &#8220;You threw away my Lake of Reincarnation water, and
          you&#8217;re expecting compliments? Gu Xianer, are you confusing your
          dreams with reality? You&#8217;d certainly wish you were as beautiful
          as your dreams.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Gu Changge, you accursed bastard! All you do is say mean
          things to me! If you think I&#8217;ll ever entertain you again,
          you&#8217;re wrong!&#8221; Gu Xianer grew infuriated, her body
          trembling out of rage. Though, her petite body didn&#8217;t quite
          display her trembling. Nonetheless, after she rebuked him, she blinked
          out of the area and disappeared.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[&#8216;You&#8217;d certainly wish you were as beautiful as your
          dreams,&#8217; he said? Was he saying that I&#8217;m ugly?] Gu Xianer
          wanted to continue rebuking him after voicing her fierceful remarks,
          but after witnessing Gu Changge&#8217;s strength, she decided not to
          do so. After some pondering, the only threatening words she could come
          up with were those that she said.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Shaking his head, Gu Changge watched as she left before withdrawing
          his smile. Truthfully, even if Gu Xianer were to drink water from the
          Lake of Reincarnation, nothing would happen. Otherwise, he
          wouldn&#8217;t have been handed the flask over to her so
          assuredly.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Given his personality, he would never do anything that was out of his
          control. Even if Gu Xianer were to restore her memories from her past
          life, and thereby get attached to her Seniors from her past life, she
          would only have two choices. Either to oppose him or sever her
          relationship with them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Either way, both choices were too cruel to Gu Xianer, and Gu Changge
          didn&#8217;t want her to have to stain her hands with the blood of her
          loved ones, as that would be outside of the kind and cheeky image he
          had of her in his mind. Therefore, discarding the water of the Lake of
          Reincarnation was indeed the best choice for her. But of course, the
          result would be the same even if she were to drink it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Essentially, a long time ago, Gu Changge found out her Dao Bone
          possessed highly complex and wonderful ancient inscriptions that were
          not of the current era. Since those inscriptions affected his
          cultivation process, he eventually destroyed them.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As a matter of fact, those inscriptions were clearly fragments of
          memories of someone’s soul. Thus, Gu Changge easily deduced that they
          were Dao Xian&#8217;s so-called Reincarnated Memories, which were
          inscribed onto the Dao Bone.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nonetheless, Gu Xianer&#8217;s Dao Bone was seized by Gu Changge back
          when she was merely a child. And now, her Dao Bone had been refined in
          Nirvana Pool, which was now incomparably pure. Hence, it bore no
          traces or imprintment from her previous life. In other words, Gu
          Changge destroyed the only way Gu Xianer could regain her memories
          from her past life a long time ago.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After the exchange with Gu Xianer, Gu Changge stopped minding her.
          Before the formidable cultivators from Purple Mansion would unleash
          their attacks on him, he brought along Qing Feng, intending to rescue
          Qing Xiaoyi. It had to be said he simply looked for a residence and
          kept her there, after he kidnapped her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Given Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s cultivation level, she would remain intact
          even if she were to be confined for years. Meanwhile, Gu Changge
          wasn&#8217;t that concerned of her safety as well, since he had
          already successfully obtained a copy of her Source, which contained
          her Celestial Demonic Physique. Though, since he did not directly
          extract it from her, she wasn&#8217;t hurt during the process.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Very soon, Gu Changge and Qing Feng hurried to the quiet, isolated
          residence that bore no residents as if it had been abandoned for many
          years. When they finally met Qing Xiaoyi, she was weaker and paler
          than before, as her delicate face obviously thinned. It was as if she
          was a pure dandelion, struggling to thrive.</span

          arrived, Qing Xiaoyi widened her eyes in stupefaction as the panic,
          perturbation and hopelessness she amassed ever since she was abducted
          gradually faded away.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          came to rescue you.&#8221; Qing Feng was so ecstatic he could barely
          speak properly, and upon his sister&#8217;s bafflement, he explained
          everything that recently happened to her. Everything, including how
          Sky King Zhi Yang abducted her and intended to hand her to the
          Successor of Demonic Arts.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Without missing any detail, Qing Feng also told her how Gu Changge
          subdued Sky King Zhi Yang and forced her whereabouts out of him before
          coming to rescue her.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >After listening to the whole story, Qing Xiaoyi was thoroughly
          stunned. As she had always looked up to Gu Changge, she expressed her
          gratitude to him. Given how Gu Changge saved her out of that devil’s
          grasp, she was even more convinced that there was some sort of
          inexplicable fate between the two of them.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          obligation to do so.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Accordingly, he brought Qing Xiaoyi and Qing Feng back to the Black
          Tortoise Empire. Upon the news, Elders from the Immortal Academy,
          including the one who gave Qing Feng the Nine-Cycles Spirit
          Restoration Pill, dashed out to receive them. Naturally, they were
          gladdened by Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s safe return, but considering another
          great matter was rising, they promptly took the siblings out of the
          empire without tarrying any longer, now that the Black Tortoise Empire
          became a land of conflict.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Since Gu Changge was now in the Black Tortoise Empire, if Purple
          Mansion wished to avenge Sky King Zhi Yang, that would be the first
          place their men would attack. Those men of Purple Mansion were each
          formidable cultivators that could effortlessly obliterate the world,
          let alone a tiny kingdom. Furthermore, hundreds of them would be
          coming, meaning a tsunami of destruction was coming.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Taking that into consideration, Gu Changge decided to leave Black
          Tortoise Empire for the time being so it wouldn&#8217;t get dragged
          into the matter. To him, the fall of such an insignificant kingdom
          meant nothing to him, as he was planning to head to Vermilion Bird
          Empire, the base of Chu Hao, another Fortuitous One, to put him

          was no way Qin Wuya would allow Gu Changge to leave any marking on
          him. After all, he was an intellectual man with countless concealment

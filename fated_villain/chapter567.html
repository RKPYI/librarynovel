          >The wine cup crashed to the ground, emitting a jarring noise that
          echoed throughout the silent banquet hall. Since it was made of
          bronze, the cup remained intact despite its fall. All eyes immediately
          turned toward the source of the noise in shock and everyone held their
          breath.</span

          >Observant cultivators noticed that Gu Changge’s sleeve was slightly
          damp, with droplets of wine still trickling down his fair, slender
          hand. This sight caused their expressions to shift dramatically,
          rendering them speechless with fear.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The sudden fall of the wine cup has left many pondering its cause. As
          the esteemed host of the banquet, Gu Changge had graciously invited
          numerous young prodigies to attend on behalf of the Ji Family.
          However, during a moment of toasting, Ji Chuyue accidentally knocked
          over the wine cup. This inevitably left some to view her actions as
          disrespectful.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Chuyue…” Jiang Chen had been discreetly observing Ji Chuyue’s
          demeanor and actions, causing him to grow concerned. He was equally
          taken aback when Ji Chuyue lost her grip on the wine cup. He surmised
          that it was likely a deliberate gesture to convey her
          discontent.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Young Master Changge, please forgive Chuyue. She didn’t do it on
          purpose.” Ji Yaoxing’s expression changed abruptly, the smile on his
          face was now frozen as he quickly apologized. He had not anticipated
          this sudden turn of events and had a bad feeling in his heart. He was
          worried that Ji Chuyue’s actions were deliberate and motivated by his
          earlier remarks</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Nevertheless, this could potentially worsen the situation. If someone
          with malicious intentions were to exploit this, they could accuse the
          Ji Family of disrespecting Gu Changge, further complicating their
          already precarious situation. All their previous efforts would be for
          naught.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Hurry up and apologize to Young Master Changge, Chuyue.” Ji Yaoxing
          urged his sister, whose face was quickly turning pale with worry. He
          didn’t even have the time to blame her for this mistake.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Please forgive me, Young Master Changge, it was truly an accident…”
          Ji Chuyue’s voice quivered with fear as she apologised. She was still
          visibly shaken and her head was ringing. She couldn’t understand why
          she had withdrawn her hand so abruptly, causing the wine cup to
          fall.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Regardless of the circumstances, it was highly inappropriate and
          disrespectful for her to knock over the wine cup and spill wine on Gu
          Changge’s hand. No one in the Upper Realm would ever dare to
          disrespect Gu Changge like this.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As Gu Changge’s smile slowly faded, Ji Chuyue’s complexion grew even
          paler. Despite being the princess of the Ji Family, she had not faced
          many challenges in her life. While she could hold a conversation with
          Gu Changge in private with her older brother by her side, standing
          before someone who held immense power in the Upper Realm made her
          realise how anxious and intimidated she truly felt.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Chuyue could barely take the pressure. Her delicate face was pale
          and she had beads of sweat forming on her forehead. Her knees were
          weak and about to give out when Gu Changge finally broke the tense
          silence.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Lady Chuyue, are you truly so frightened of me that you cannot even
          hold a wine cup?” He gently shook his head without a calm look on his
          face. His voice was natural and relaxed, and he didn&#8217;t seem to
          be blaming her. Even so, both Ji Chuyue and Ji Yaoxing were still
          feeling extremely on edge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;No&#8230; Nothing like that, Young Master Changge. I was just
          a little distracted earlier, please forgive me,” Ji Chuyue explained
          with a slight tremble in her voice.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Oh, what distracted you, Lady Chuyue?” Gu Changge inquired with
          interest. Ji Chuyue turned even paler as she couldn’t reveal her
          concerns about her brother’s issues with Jiang Chen. At the same time,
          she struggled to come up with a suitable excuse.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Yaoxing noticed his sister’s distracted expression but couldn’t
          figure out what was causing it. He sighed inwardly and quickly stood
          up, smiling wryly as he apologetically explained, “Well, the reason
          may amuse you, Young Master Changge. When Chuyue heard that you were
          going to gather many prodigies to strategize the rescue of our Prime
          Ancestor, she was extremely grateful to you and kept bringing up your
          name in front of me so I casually mentioned to her that our family
          intends to have her become your concubine…”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Although he knew that his explanation was not very convincing, he
          couldn’t find another suitable excuse either. Even if Ji Chuyue wanted
          to become Gu Changge’s concubine, it would ultimately depend on
          whether Gu Changge was willing to accept her or not, given her status.
          After all, many prodigal damsels in the Upper Realm desired to be his
          concubine.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His explanation surprised and saddened many young prodigies at the
          banquet, but they didn’t doubt it. Gu Changge’s exceptional qualities
          made him an irresistible man to any prodigal damsels, including Ji
          Chuyue. This must have been the reason why she was so nervous and
          accidentally spilled the wine earlier. It all made sense.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Brother…!” Ji Chuyue obviously didn’t expect her brother to say
          that, and a blush immediately crept up her cheeks. Though she
          understood that he was coming to her aid, Ji Yaoxing didn’t consider
          her feelings at all when he used such an explanation so publicly. Her
          cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she felt a sense of shame. She
          wished she could dig a hole and hide in it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Chuyue, there’s no need to feel embarrassed. It’s nothing to be
          ashamed of,” Ji Yaoxing reassured her with a smile.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Oh, I see. Lady Chuyue, there’s no need to be nervous. I’m not a
          savage beast.” Gu Changge’s expression remained unchanged when he
          heard the explanation and merely smiled.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Ji Yaoxing couldn’t tell whether or not Gu Changge believed it, but
          he was relieved that the other party didn’t continue pressing the
          issue. He let out a long sigh, relieved that the tension had been
          defused.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When Ji Yaoxing noticed Yin Mei produced a white handkerchief behind
          Gu Changge and delicately wiped away the wine that had spilled onto
          his hand, he shot a look at his sister. Ji Chuyue understood his
          intentions and stepped forward. Her face and the tips of her ears were
          still burning.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“My apologies for accidentally wetting your sleeve earlier, Young
          Master Changge.” While speaking, she delicately took out a plain
          handkerchief and carefully wiped Gu Changge’s hand. Her hands were
          shaky, probably due to nervousness. The sight of her flawless face up
          close and the faint fragrance of her silky hair brought a smile on Gu
          Changge’s face as he allowed her to continue.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many young prodigies didn’t perceive any fault in her action, on the
          contrary, many prodigal damsels were filled with envy.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What a clever ploy. She purposely spilled the wine, merely to seize
          the chance to approach Young Master Changge. This Ji Chuyue is quite
          the character&#8230; She accomplished what we yearned for but lacked
          the courage to execute.” A few prodigal damsels were consumed with
          envy, and their words were tinged with bitterness.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Shut up. Chuyue is different from all of you. She’s not a sparrow
          with aspirations of becoming a phoenix by reaching for the highest
          branch!” Jiang Chen spoke sternly, his eyes slightly reddened. He held
          his fists tightly, causing his knuckles to crack with tension.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Unfortunately, his words fell on deaf ears. Following the incident at
          the Divine Rock Conference, many young prodigies no longer felt the
          need to treat him with respect despite his status as the Successor of
          a Divine Source Master. These prodigal damsels looked upon him with
          disdain and refused to speak, leaving him feeling foolish.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen’s countenance contorted with displeasure, his complexion
          turning ashen with fury simmering within him. In his perspective, it
          was glaringly apparent that Ji Chuyue had been coerced into performing
          the task, rather than doing it willingly. As the princess of the Ji
          Family, her status was beyond measure, and her beauty was akin to that
          of a fairy from heaven. When had she ever tended to a young man’s
          hands with such meticulous care? This realisation made Jiang Chen’s
          heart ache for her.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Ah’chen, calm down. You mustn’t act impulsively.” Niu Tian
          immediately sensed something was amiss when he saw the expression on
          Jiang Chen’s face. He swiftly intervened, urging him to remain
          composed.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“How can I remain calm at a time like this?” Jiang Chen gritted his
          teeth. His heart twitched as he looked at Gu Changge calmly sitting in
          the host’s seat while Ji Chuyue carefully wiped his hand with flushed
          cheeks.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To Jiang Chen, the scene before him was akin to watching a delicate,
          pristine white flower growing on the edge of a treacherous abyss,
          vulnerable to the slightest gust of wind that could send its petals
          into oblivion.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Just as Jiang Chen was about to stand up for Ji Chuyue, Ji Yaoxing
          suddenly turned his gaze in his direction. The humble and respectful
          expression on his face had vanished, replaced by aloofness as he
          coldly ordered, “Someone, seize that person!”</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Swish! Swoosh!* As soon as Ji Yaoxing’s voice fell, a group of
          armored knights came into the hall and surrounded Jiang Chen. It was
          evident that they had been lying in wait for quite some time, ready
          for this exact moment. Their sudden appearance caught Jiang Chen off
          guard, causing his rage to dissipate instantly as he stood frozen in
          shock.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone present at the banquet, including the Phoenix Lady, the King
          with Six Crowns, and the Sky Demon Sovereign, were utterly bewildered
          and stunned. None of them expected Ji Yaoxing’s command to have Jiang
          Chen apprehended.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“What’s going on?” An Xi and the Young War Immortal rose to their
          feet, their expressions a mix of confusion and astonishment as they
          turned to look behind them. After all, Jiang Chen had been in their
          company all this while and they were acquainted with him.</span

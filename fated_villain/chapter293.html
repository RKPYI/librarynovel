          finish, interrupting him coldly with a condescending and careless look
          in his eyes. It gave everyone the impression that Gu Changge did not

          remain secret in this world, plus Junior Brother Wang didn&#8217;t do
          it on purpose. He can compensate for any loss the lady has
          suffered.&#8221; Chu Hao frowned. He had already humbled himself
          enough and pleaded with Gu Changge. Yet, the other refused to offer
          him any courtesy nor respect for Supreme Cave Heaven.</span

          >Chu Hao had his own pride to consider. He was only concerned about
          the forces behind Gu Changge. After all, he had already reached the
          Sacred King Realm after only a few hundred years. He had kept a low
          profile and refused to leak out any information, or he would have
          shocked the entire world and gained the attention of the forces
          everywhere. Gu Changge might be the so-called greatest of the younger
          generation, but he&#8217;s only at this level. The stronger young
          prodigies were around the Sacred Realm right now while he was on his
          way to breakthrough to the Sacred Emperor Realm.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His ego made him unable to accept Gu Changge’s behaviour. However, he
          had mostly let it up because of his respect towards his father.
          Nonetheless, Gu Changge&#8217;s behaviour towards him today had
          enraged him.</span

          asked mildly. &#8220;You might think that he has the right, but sadly,
          he&#8217;s no more than a hair on Qingge&#8217;s head to me. He had
          caused her to be wounded so badly. His punishment will be too light if
          I don&#8217;t cut him into pieces!&#8221;</span

          >His tone was mild and calm, yet shocked everyone especially Su Qingge
          and Ji Qingxuan. The two of them had changed their identity but felt
          like he was directing those words at them. They felt extremely
          flustered and couldn&#8217;t calm down. The other prodigal damsels
          were all smitten and envious. How many women could incite such words
          from Gu Changge? These women would live happily for the rest of their
          lives!</span

          >*Boom!* Gu Changge refused to play around any longer and immediately
          attacked. His surging power transformed into a terrifying golden
          millstone as he reached out a hand, blocking out the sky and grinding
          downwards. Runes streamed down from him and Principles weaved around
          it.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Such an attack was far too aggressive. Even Old Xuan, who was in the
          Sacred Lord Realm, became stricken with fear once he felt the
          terrifying aura. His body tingled with pain as if ready to crack open.
          The other young prodigies were worse off, running off in fear to avoid
          being caught in the aftershock.</span

          could counter against. Yet, came from Gu Changge, simply reaching out
          his hand. The young prodigies from the Immortal Academy could feel how
          immense it was and their eyes widened in disbelief.</span

          they did not pause as they raced away as divine rainbows. They feared
          that the impending battle would implicate the entire capital of the
          Vermillion Bird Empire and destroy everything.</span

          he hadn&#8217;t anticipated the other to suddenly attack without
          saying a word. He had no choice but to grab Wang Xiao by the hand and
          retreat for safety. If he attacked Gu Changge, that meant he would
          offend the great and terrifying force behind him? The feeling of
          helplessness made him frustrated.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Boom!* As he retreated, Gu Changge&#8217;s palm dropped downwards
          and caused the buildings beneath to explode. A large crevice split the
          capital, and large swathes of palaces and mansions were now reduced to
          powder. Any who couldn&#8217;t escape in time died with a scream, as
          both their bodies and spirits were annihilated.

          was deeply attached to it. Gu Changge would not hold any concerns to
          it but he did. Especially those cultivators, who were familiar to him,

          Empire, yet here you are opposing me to save your so-called Junior
          Brother while ignoring your citizens. Does that mean they aren&#8217;t

          frustration of many from the Vermillion Bird Empire. They did not dare
          blame Gu Changge. So, their thoughts immediately went to cursing how
          Chu Hao dared to protect his Junior Brother and offend Gu Changge,
          instead of protecting his people? Anyone could see that Gu Changge had
          to be given closure for this. Yet, Chu Hao had to risk himself and the
          lives of his people to protect Wang Xiao. This was clear
          provocation!</span

          consciousness be clear when you&#8217;ve plotted all of this?&#8221;
          Chu Hao&#8217;s voice was cold, as he had already understood the
          meaning of Gu Changge&#8217;s words. However, he couldn&#8217;t voice
          out his troubles right now nor give a good explanation to those of the
          Empire.</span

          merely taking advantage of the chance he was given. His target had

          father. He was an extremely sentimental person. Otherwise, he
          wouldn&#8217;t have rushed back after knowing that the Empire was

          >&#8220;A Sacred Emperor Grade Weapon!&#8221; Everyone turned pale
          with shock. It was surprising enough that Chu Hao exhibited Sacred
          King Realm strength, yet Gu Changge immediately utilised a Sacred
          Emperor Grade Weapon. The crowd felt cold from fear and their scalps
          tingled. How resourceful must a youth be to possess a Sacred Emperor
          weapon!? It was unimaginable, yet it was all too real as Gu Changge
          had already activated and wielded it.</span

          >&#8220;You…&#8221; Chu Hao&#8217;s expression shifted violently
          before he suppressed his anger. He hadn&#8217;t expected Gu Changge to
          be prepared for this scenario and wield a Sacred Emperor Grade Weapon.
          If they fought it out, the entire capital would be reduced to ruins.
          The other territories of the Empire might not be able to withstand the
          onslaught as well since the aftershocks could reach a great distance
          away. He had thought Gu Changge would be intimidated by the Sacred
          King energy he exuded and retreated. However, Gu Changge had instead
          displayed more of his methods, which was something he never had
          expected.</span

          never let the Empire go so easily. You know my uncle would…&#8221;
          Wang Xiao immediately shouted. He had understood the situation and
          fell silent when he saw how silent Chu Hao was. Especially the
          latter’s conflicted expression. He could feel his heart stutter as the
          fear from before surged through his body.</span

          looking pale, confused and shocked, arrived accompanied by Gu
          Changge&#8217;s followers. He felt panicked and anxious about the
          entire situation as he didn&#8217;t know what was happening. Gu
          Changge probably wanted to destroy the Empire since he was wielding a
          Sacred Emperor Grade Weapon!</span

      <p>

          >&#8220;Father…&#8221; Chu Hao gritted his teeth and forced himself to
          calm down. He felt frustrated and unhappy as he looked at the prideful
          yet calm expression on Gu Changge&#8217;s face. His had never felt so
          humiliated and embarrassed before. However, he couldn&#8217;t do
          anything but compromise when Gu Changge had already captured his
          father.</span

          asked slowly, looking anxiously at Gu Changge.</span

          don&#8217;t need to worry too much.&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and
          glanced at his followers. &#8220;I told you to invite the Emperor; who
          asked you to be disrespectful to him?&#8221;</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          not be strict about such things. You can all get up.&#8221;</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The cultivators watching the scene shivered with fear. Even the
          Emperor was putty in Gu Changge&#8217;s hands now, which meant they
          were no more than tiny bugs to the latter.</span

          >&#8220;Father, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221; Chu Hao shook his head and
          relaxed his fists, deciding to yield to Gu Changge. His terrifying
          Sacred King Realm aura evaporated, signalling that he had made his
          decision.</span

          Changge smiled without saying more. The Seal hovering behind him
          shivered and made a wisp of Principle fall from it, before it dropped
          onto Wang Xiao. The man had no chance to defend himself at all as he
          exploded at once, dead in both body and soul.

          Gu Changge, and covered in blood, was filled with many emotions.
          Happiness, freedom, satisfaction… the feeling was indescribable. The
          man who she had to be careful not to offend, was easily crushed like a
          bug.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          as the Fortuity and Fatums he had gained from bringing down the
          Fortuitous One was no small number. Nonetheless, he wasn&#8217;t so
          anxious about Chu Hao. He knew he could gain more benefits from
          exploiting the prince little by little.</span

          QIngxuan smiled sweetly and sincerely at him. She had expected him to
          carry her like before, but he walked past her instead after talking to
          her. Ji Qingxuan almost wondered if he had noticed something wrong and
          began to panic, before remembering what Qingge had told her. Gu
          Changge had always behaved like this, refusing to do anything which
          wasn&#8217;t meaningful to him.

          made her relieved. Still, she now realised Gu Changge was a man hard
          to read, and she couldn&#8217;t be sure if he had noticed
          anything.</span

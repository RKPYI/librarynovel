        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various Immortal and Formidable Forces had gathered in the Sky Domain of the Upper Realm, where the Capital of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was located. At some point, a wave of smoke signals had filled the air, and swords were on the verge of being pulled out. Everyone was on edge and extremely uneasy.</span><span id="more-34818"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hum!* A vague and frightening figure stood in the depths of Great Yu Palace, staring at the current Emperor Yu indifferently, demanding an explanation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Space Rift leading to Profound Sword World had closed out of nowhere some time ago. Many cultivators guarding there tried to re-open it, but all of them failed. Even some Quasi-Nirvana Realm experts had tried in vain. They couldn&#8217;t find the space node of that world to open up the passage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This matter caused a great commotion, which led to many Forces around the Sky Domain to immediately dispatch their experts. It would be an incalculable and unpredictable loss if their True Daoists and Successors, who had gone there, were trapped in that world and were unable to come back.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And right when all the Forces were studying how to open this Space Rift, They suddenly received shocking terrible news. The Soul Lamps left by the Ancestors of all Forces who went had abruptly gone out. Their aura had also completely disappeared. They lost their lives in that world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news caused a great commotion in the entire Sky Domain. No matter if it was an ordinary cultivator or a disciple of a Force, everyone was left trembling in fear and disbelief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this era, True Daoists could be said to be existences who stood at the peak. They were the ones whose cultivation was unrivalled, as they stood above everyone else. In fact, any Force that had a True Daoist could live for millions of years without worry. No one would dare to provoke them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, such a powerful existence had actually died in a Lower Realm World. And it wasn&#8217;t just one person. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that went died! No one knew what exactly was hidden in that world and what kind of terrifying danger it contained. Nevertheless, the news was so shocking that everyone who heard it gaped and wondered if they had heard it wrong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, the legitimacy of this news was confirmed. Not only did the True Daoists who came to that world die, but even the rest of the army that went with them was wiped out. It was like they had thrown a pebble into the ocean. There was no news about them after that. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no doubt that this news incurred the wrath of everyone. Many experts immediately went to the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty to demand an explanation. After all, the Space Rift which served as the entrance to that world was discovered by the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. The location also happened to be within the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s territory. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could be said that the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was being blamed for such a major incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty had a profound history and a solid foundation, this event shook them up. They themselves did not know what had happened. Nevertheless, this matter was too big for fingers to not be pointed. Moreover, the Imperial Ancestor, who was a True Daoist, also went to that world together with their army, and died. It was only natural that the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty didn&#8217;t want to see something like this happen as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please ease your anger, Fellow Brothers and Fellow Sisters. We, too, did not wish for such a major incident to happen. Not only did the Ancestors from your Forces die, but the Life Plaque of our True Daoist Imperial Ancestor has also shattered&#8230;&#8221; The tall and burly Emperor Yu, who stood in the Great Yu Palace with a purple gold crown on his head, typically had a calm and prestigious expression. However, he expression at this moment was filled with anxiety as he cupped his fists and apologised to the experts from the various Forces who had rushed over. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering how everyone here was Sect Master or Family Head, their identities were simply unimaginable. Emperor Yu couldn&#8217;t possibly put on airs or behave too contemptuously.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmph! Anyway, the incident happened in your territory. Great Yu was also the one who spread news that a world had appeared. Now that something has happened, your Great Yu Celestial Dynasty cannot escape taking the blame.&#8221; An Ancient Being from Sky Emperor Mountain complained. His dissatisfaction was evident on his face. One of his most promising descendants had joined the army that headed to Profound Sword World. The Ancient Being felt like his heart was bleeding, now that the descendant had fallen. All the time and effort the Ancient Being had put into teaching the descendant had gone to waste. He couldn&#8217;t possibly take this lying down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The experts from the other Forces also looked glum. On top of not gaining anything from this trip to that Lower Realm world, they had also lost many young prodigies and True Daoists. It was a heavy loss for them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu also quietly sighed when he heard this. He knew that things wouldn&#8217;t end on a good note at this rate. He also had no idea what happened in Profound Sword World, which lead to the downfall of True Daoists from various Forces. Even the Space Rift they use to enter Profound Sword World had closed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have to think it through, Emperor Yu. It is only us who have gone. That man from the Gu Family seems to have gone there too, and his whereabouts is still unknown. No one knows if he is dead or alive. If he happens to have met his doom there… I&#8217;m afraid you will have a hard time saving yourself against the fury of the Gu Family.&#8221; An Ancient Being from Godly Spirit Mountain spoke in a tone dripping with ridicule as the same emotion flashed in his eyes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu&#8217;s face immediately fell as soon as these words left the mouth of the Ancient Being. The palms under his robe couldn&#8217;t help but clench tightly. In fact, this was what he was most worried about. After all, Gu Changge was among the younger generation who went to that world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Gu Changge was so powerful that not even a True Daoist was a worthy opponent, no one could say for sure what happened in the Profound Sword World. Thus, no one could guarantee that Gu Changge had survived the incident.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a certain sense, Gu Changge, who was the Young Master of the Gu family, was no different from being the Head of the Gu Family. Furthermore, describing his talent as ‘unparalleled’ and ‘time-transcending’ wouldn&#8217;t be an overstatement. It was only a matter of time before he entered the Immortal Realm. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge had died, the impact would definitely be numerous times more shocking than the death of a True Daoist. By then, the Immortal Gu Family would definitely get into an Immortal War with the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Not to mention, the other Immortal Forces, including the Primal Celestial Temple, also known as Primal Demonic Temple, who Gu Changge&#8217;s mother was from and the Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty. Many of such forces were going to get involved… Just the thought of how many Forces would get involved made everyone fearful and restless.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancient existence from Sky Emperor Mountain had a sympathetic glint in his eyes as he shook his head. &#8220;Emperor Yu, you better think of the next step to deal with this, or all hell will break loose in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty this time.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Sky Emperor Mountain had also suffered considerable losses, they were doing much better than the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present, many Forces in the Upper Realm were paying close attention to the situation here. If the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty failed to handle it well, the Forces that would take action against them would definitely not be limited to just a few. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And right when the experts were having a discussion about this matter, a vast burst of energy suddenly broke up on the land at the border of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky started to tremble, and the weather changed when an extremely terrifying crack suddenly appeared in the sky as if torn open by a pair of giant hands that couldn&#8217;t be seen with the naked eye. From this crack, endless rays of light and Chaos Qi gushed out, filling the wilderness in an instant. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area proceeded to look like it had been torn apart by an eternal light when all kinds of runes soared into the sky, immediately illuminating the sky. Even the cold and dark depths of the universe were as bright as day in that instant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An ancient and majestic ancient battleship smeared with blood and bones came rumbling and crushing its way over, as if it had come from a vast land and was breaking through all the World Principles to rush over in desperation. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is… a Great Yu&#8217;s ancient battleship!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did it appear here? Wait, this looks like the army that headed to that world…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The momentum and commotion was so big that the ship&#8217;s arrival immediately alarmed all the cultivators in the vicinity. One after another, divine rainbows swept across the sky and came down towards this place. Everyone couldn&#8217;t help but be astonished by the sight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though what happened in Profound Sword World had not been completely spread throughout the whole Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, there was much gossip about it and it was spreading fast. It was why a lot of cultivators were clueless to the fact that all Forces that had entered that world had suffered heavy losses they couldn&#8217;t make up for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What the hell? Just what is going on?! We have to pass news of what happened here to His Majesty Emperor Yu. At least one ancient battleship has returned safely!] Many of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s informants, who were in hiding, were shocked at first, but when they came back to their senses, they quickly sent the information back to the Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I really came back. Finally, this familiar aura of our world&#8230;&#8221; Boarding the ancient battleship was Yu Feiya, the Eldest Princess of Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, who had a complicated expression on her face. Despite feeling a little at ease, she knew that there would be more trouble even though things might seem stable now because Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t shown up. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the leader who guided the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s younger generation to Profound Sword World, Yu Feiya would naturally be the first to bear the brunt of everyone&#8217;s anger and blame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was for this that Gu Changge let her live.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Although there are Early, Intermediate, and Advanced Minor Realms in the Nirvana Realm, there is a large disparity between reach Minor Realm.] Gu Changge motionlessly sat cross-legged in a palace on an ancient battleship. His face was calm, and his body was like a rock. Wisps of black light hanging above his head trickled down and into every pore, as though billions of stars intertwined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Gu Changge devoured and refined Profound Sword World&#8217;s Source, his cultivation had increased a lot compared to before. He was considered to be in the Early Nirvana Realm at most, but now, he had reached close to the Advanced Nirvana Realm. Of course, the leap in his strength was obvious. Even Gu Changge didn&#8217;t know what he was capable of doing with his current strength.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the Profound Sword World unrivalled figure manifested from the Ancestral Symbol had powers of an Immortal, it was only a manifestation. Not having an actual body made it hard for it to compete with a True Immortal. Still, it was stronger than those Remnant Immortals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge looked at the Heavenly Gift that fell out after he killed the Fortuitous Ones &#8211; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao and Lin En. [Heavenly Heart Symbol and Sword Dao Sacred Heart… These two things are of little use to me as I am now. Still, guess it’s better than having nothing.] </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He only found these after he left the Profound Sword World and opened the Heavenly Gift Treasure Chests.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavenly Heart Symbol was similar to the Heavenly Dao Symbol. It was golden and incomparably misty. It needs to be used alongside an ownerless world. It can be used to refine that world to get a hold of the Heavenly Dao Authority there and maybe even form a manifestation of the world. However, this was something of little value to Gu Changge. He plans on giving it to Yue Mingkong when he has time. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The Unrivalled Celestial Dynasty is an expert in the Dao of Space and Worlds. Yue Mingkong can put this to use to further her mastery in that Dao. It would certainly be unique feat in the Upper Realm.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Sword Dao Sacred Heart, it was a kind of Sword Dao Talent which could be used to train the disciples or younger generations. This was even more useless to Gu Changge, but he decided to keep it just because he might be able to use it in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[It is impossible for the Upper Realm to not pay attention to such a big incident in the Profound Sword World&#8230; I should stay out of the limelight for some time. If anything happens, I&#8217;ll let Yu Feiya take the first blow.] Gu Changge kept the Heavenly Gifts and came to the side of the ancient battleship before he looked down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he was now in the territory of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, he would be able to return to the capital in a while. There were five True Daoists from five different Immortal Forces who had met their doom in Profound Sword World. Because of that, an Immortal War might break out if this matter was not resolved well. After all, the fall of a True Daoist was a major event for any Force.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[I&#8217;ll make use of this opportunity to have Yu Tianzheng make a move. It&#8217;s time for the Dynasty to change hands.] Many thoughts flashed through Gu Changge&#8217;s mind, and his gaze suddenly deepened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was currently a gathering of experts from all Forces in the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. No matter who it was, there was no doubt that these Forces would be the first to be suspected if Emperor Yu fell at this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, in the Capital of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, Emperor Yu was discussing the issue with the experts from all the Forces when he first learnt the news that an ancient battleship of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty had returned safely. His face froze, and after the initial shock, he was in deep disbelief. He couldn&#8217;t believe what he heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? One of our ancient battleships has returned safely?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supreme experts of various Forces beside him naturally heard about it as well. Their expressions immediately changed into ones of shock, anger, and suspicion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To them, having everyone else perish but those from the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty could only mean one thing—the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty was trying to set them up so they could eliminate everyone else!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu was a smart person. As he instantly understood what everyone was thinking, he hurriedly reassured everyone to calm their emotions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fellow Brothers and Fellow Sisters, please don&#8217;t worry, and please don&#8217;t be impatient. I have only just found out about this matter as well. We can wait for the army to return to the capital and ask them what happened in that world. I&#8217;m sure everyone won&#8217;t act out of haste now.&#8221;</span></p>

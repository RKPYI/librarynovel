        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside a cave overflowing with a terrifying aura, heavenly light glistened as
                celestial energy intertwined. Even those that were kneeling outside the cave could feel the overwhelming
                pressure gushing out of the cave. Their faces paled and their bodies trembled, as they were baffled by
                their Master&#8217;s unexpected rage.</span><span id="more-27913"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, no matter what situation their Master was in, he was always a calm
                man that believed he was in control of everything, indifferent to all matters. Even if the sky were to
                collapse, he would still retain his straight face.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did Master himself face some sort of trouble? Is it perhaps related to the
                individual from the Immortal Gu Family who suddenly came?] They guessed in their hearts.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to that, their Master never showed any interest in the Immortal Gu
                Family, let alone inquiring about them. Therefore, they subconsciously assumed that their Master was
                detestful towards the Successor of the Immortal Gu Family Essentially, according to the ongoing rumours,
                the Successor of the Immortal Gu Family was an unbelievably overpowered being.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although their Master once repressed the world and became the number one
                cultivator of the world, he never once showed up in the world ever since, so there was no telling what
                would happen if he were to face the Successor of the Immortal Gu Family.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, inside the cave, the man in purple was still unable to accept the
                outcome as his eyes were filled with shock and dismay.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible! Isn&#8217;t Gu Changge her cousin? Why would
                he do such a thing? I knew Gu Changge is no honest man! Everything he&#8217;s doing in front of the
                world is only pretence! He&#8217;s a heartless, cruel man, and returning the bone to his cousin is
                nothing but a joke!&#8221; Followingly, the man in purple calmed himself down as his eyes were gleaming
                with all sorts of emotions. He didn&#8217;t doubt what he witnessed with the Foreseeing Eye, and the
                young man in the vision was unquestionably Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he had never met Gu Changge before, he had seen pictures of him, and
                the latter looked exactly the same in his vision. As for the woman in green who was chained up in the
                freezing, moist underground prison, she was Dao Xian, his Junior in her past life.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did he know, his Junior was now going by the name Gu Xianer, and she
                was a proud prodigy of the Immortal Gu Family. When she was merely a child, her Dao Bone was seized by
                her cousin, Gu Changge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After such a devastating childhood and countless obstacles, she eventually
                appeared in Skyward Schloss, and eventually, that was when Gu Changge was left with no choice but to
                confess his tie with her to the world, thereby returning the Dao Bone to Gu Xianer.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the man in purple returned to the world late, by the time he knew what had
                happened, Gu Changge had already returned the Dao Bone to Gu Xianer. Thus, the man in purple thought all
                grudges were relieved, he never expected to see the fragmented vision from such an angle. As such, there
                were frightening screams roaring in his heart as he was unable to cool himself down.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, he thought now would be the time for his battle of life and
                death against Gu Xianer. In his past life, not only did she refuse to reciprocate his feelings, but she
                even shattered his dream of pursuing her. Back then, his dear Junior was such a prideful cultivator that
                put all her heart into pursuing the Great Dao without getting distracted by any obtrusion, to the point
                where she ultimately shut her Sect Elders out.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, an incidental disaster took not only him by surprise, but his Sect as
                well, and of course, his dear Junior. Never expecting himself to regress, he was once a disciple with
                unremarkable Talents in his Sect. Compared to Gu Xianer, he was extremely inferior.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a miracle happened. He regressed.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The epoch they once lived in was then recorded as a painful, historic time
                that no one dared to remember. Even though he had regained his memories, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel
                dejected and fearful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that tragic day, the entire world withered. Even the Immortals, who were
                regarded to be undying and invincible, perished at the obliterating, all-powerful blow. Many weeped as
                their Ancestors fell. Even the heavenly palaces that sat above reincarnation, looking over the world,
                were disintegrated in one day.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for common men, their lives were taken by the palm of annihilation that
                left realms lifeless. And so, none dared to ever bring up the epoch again. Even the man in purple could
                only hear ambiguous, broken words which were later turned into taboo.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time went by, after numberless epochs deteriorated along the blooming of
                the Flower of Reincarnation, he finally regressed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believed in reincarnation, and he also believed that his excellent Junior
                would some day resurface in the world together with him, which he had been waiting for a long
                time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why would you turn out this way? This isn&#8217;t like you at
                all…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, the man in purple gritted his teeth, intending to use the
                Foreseeing Eyes once again. Although it was for merely a fragment of vision into the future, doing that
                would impose a great price onto himself. Using the Foreseeing Eyes twice in one day would mean that he
                would be paralysed for half a year, and the inevitable, great price for peeking into the future would be
                the severe damage on his Source.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next moment, his vision turned blurry again as traces of time flowed. At
                once, the face of the man in purple blanched as the picture reappeared. It was the same cold, moist
                underground prison. All of a sudden, he could feel a pair of eyes from the moment of the future turning
                to him, as if the young man in the vision sensed something.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man then raised his head and revealed a fascinated grin. His
                emotionless gaze fell upon the man in purple as if he could see through space and time.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Interesting.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that one word, the man in purple could feel his head about to
                explode. The third eye on his forehead tore even wider, continuously bleeding. Nevertheless, what left
                him shocked was that Gu Changge noticed his observation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Blargh!&#8221; He spewed a mouthful of blood. Although the vision
                quickly faded away, he remained disturbed, shaking out of fear.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge is more than meets the eye. He&#8217;s much more terrifying
                than whatever that was mentioned in the rumours. How does such a monstrosity exist in this world…&#8221;
                The face of the man in purple grew graver than ever.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Brother, the Elders said I have Celestial Demonic Physique. What
                physique is that?&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a manor with heavenly mist and vibrant lights, Qing Feng and Qing
                Xiaoyi, who sported a new look, were conversing. Their appearances were completely different from that
                when they were at the entrance to the Immortal Academy, bearing not the slightest resemblance of a
                miserable tramp. Instead, they seemed like disciples of a certain Sect with the flashiness on them.
                Evidently, their makeover was quite successful, given how there was no longer grime on them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qing Xiaoyi donned a plain white dress with simple accessories. Her dress was
                subtly gleaming with intertwining Divine Chains of Order, highlighting her youthfulness and innocence as
                a little girl. At that moment, she was asking Qing Feng about her physique which she was curious
                about.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Qing Feng chuckled. &#8220;Xiao Yao, all you need to know is
                that you possess a very, very powerful Talent. See, all the Elders want you to be their disciple. If it
                weren&#8217;t for you, I would never have made it into Immortal Academy. It seems what we know about
                paradise, compared to Immortal Palace, shows how little we know. They are incomparable… Even the water
                we drink comes from the unseen divine spring, which is invaluable to the outside world.&#8221;</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, he felt absolutely flabbergasted. If it weren&#8217;t his
                sister, he would have remained a worthless beggar, and he wouldn&#8217;t dare to imagine himself
                learning about cultivation, training, and the Great Dao. Although he didn&#8217;t have a Spiritual Root,
                the Elders transplanted one into him in order to please Qing Xiaoyi. And in a blink of an eye, he was
                now a small prodigy with exceptional Talent. Besides, although he was nothing compared to the servants
                of the young talents in Immortal Academy, he was satisfied with what he was given.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Qing Xiaoyi, thanks to her frightening Talents, was
                instantly turned into the salivating centre of attention by the Elders as they wished to take her in
                despite the fact that she was only thirteen years old and had never cultivated, and other young talents
                would never dare to wish for what she possessed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But Brother, I don&#8217;t want to cultivate. The eyes of the Elders
                scares me. I can feel that they&#8217;re seeing me not as a human, but as an item.&#8221; In response,
                Qing Xiaoyi restlessly stated, &#8220;To me, all I want is to live happily with you without starving, or
                getting bullied, and one day, we are going to look for the cultivator who killed Grandpa and avenge
                Grandpa. The world of cultivation is so cruel… I&#8217;m scared…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xiaoyi, I understand your concern. It&#8217;s all my fault for being
                useless, for being unable to protect you and giving you a worriless life…&#8221; Qing Feng remorsefully
                replied.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, Brother. To be honest, back when we were at the
                entrance, if the Elders hadn&#8217;t shown up, I feel that we could have followed Young Master Changge.
                Young Master Changge is kind, I can feel that his eyes when he looked at us were normal, unlike the
                others who simply saw us as monkeys.&#8221; Qing Xiaoyi&#8217;s voice dropped as she spoke, as though
                she was bashful.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the little girl that was about thirteen years old faced the situation
                back then, the only person that came to their defence was the noble, unparalleled man who was completely
                out of their world. As such, she couldn&#8217;t help but feel as if she was living in a dream.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, lately, the scenario back then kept replaying in Qing
                Xiaoyi&#8217;s mind. If it weren&#8217;t for the Elders&#8217; interruption, she would have become Gu
                Changge&#8217;s sword servant just like her brother. Moreover, with Gu Changge by their side, no one
                would dare to bully them, which was quite delightful to fantasise about.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;True, Young Master Changge is indeed different from the rest, but Xiao
                Yi, perhaps you should stop thinking about that. What happened back then was nothing to Young Master
                Changge. Don&#8217;t take that in a wrong way. Remember, even though we are the disciples of Immortal
                Academy now, the difference between us and Young Master Changge is unimaginable… I doubt a person like
                him would even remember our names.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at his sister&#8217;s delusional face, Qing Feng felt obliged to
                advise her with a bitter grin.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, Brother, what are you on about? I didn&#8217;t take it
                the wrong way. I&#8217;m just thinking that, if we ever have the chance, we have to show our gratitude
                to Young Master Changge. What are you talking about…&#8221; Qing Xiaoyi hastily denied, waving her hand.
                Yet, there was an obvious pair of blush on her snowy cheeks as though her true thoughts got exposed.
                Besides, since she was now recognised as a disciple by numerous Elders, she just might get the chance to
                meet Gu Changge in the future.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh…&#8221; Followingly, Qing Feng heaved a sigh, shaking his head as
                he departed.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since his sister and him lived in different manors, he returned to his room.
                And after making sure that no one was around, he warily pulled out a flask from his chest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an old flask the size of a palm. Without any carving or ornaments, it
                seemed ordinary. However, it was the very flask that caused the old beggar who took them in previously
                to be killed by cultivators. And thanks to the fact that the siblings weren&#8217;t around that time,
                they managed to escape the slaughter.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, according to the hints left behind by the old beggar, Qing Feng
                eventually found the flask in the broken well they usually use. Since it was the legacy of the old
                beggar, Qing Feng naturally took good care of it, though he didn&#8217;t really know the function of the
                flask.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, it was not until this day that he found out the flask was
                absorbing his spiritual energy when he was cultivating. And in return, it gave him a more refined, more
                wondrous energy. The energy was heavy, as if small traces of it could bring the sky down.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Qing Feng wasn&#8217;t exactly knowledgeable, even he could tell
                that the energy was the rumoured Chaos Energy that could collapse an entire mountain. The Chaos energy
                was currently nourishing his blood, bones, and organs.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possessing such a priceless treasure, Qing Feng was undoubtedly careful,
                fearing that the others would find out about it. After all, with so many strong cultivators in Immortal
                Academy, a slight mistake would cause the flask to be detected. Thus, he even kept it from his own
                sister.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge!&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Gu Changge showed up at the entrance of the Immortal
                Academy. As of late, Immortal Academy had grown highly exuberant as young prodigies from various regions
                hurried over. As young prodigies and ancient abominations were gathered here, the atmosphere was
                shockingly intimidating. Therefore, more Elders were assigned to be in charge of verifying the
                visitors&#8217; bone age.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, an old man in white named Wang Zhongyong saw Gu Changge and
                approached him with a beaming smile. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;To what does Immortal Academy owe the pleasure, Young Master
                Changge?&#8221; he asked.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a doubt, Gu Changge&#8217;s arrival caused a remarkable disturbance
                as young prodigies immediately turned around and found themselves dumbfounded. It was the first time for
                many young prodigies to see Gu Changge in real life, and there was nothing but curiosity and admiration
                in their eyes.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as there was a layer of mist wafting around Gu Changge&#8217;s body,
                his face was rather hard to be perceived, as if he was in another world. The glorified, all-seeing young
                man who grabbed all the attention standing on a boulder appeared deeply ethereal and surreal. Even the
                young women couldn&#8217;t help but feel absolute adoration towards him.</span></p>

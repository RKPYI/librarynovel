          sky to this particular location. Lin Wu&#8217;s hair was curled as his
          dragon-like body pierced through the sky. He had an astonishing aura.
          In fact, his cultivation was the top among his peers in the Eight

          burning with seemingly inextinguishable flames that could scorch the
          sky. The land stretching hundreds of thousands of kilometres was
          barren without any signs of life. However, they were helpless despite

          they were going to face now were thousands of times more terrifying
          than those they saw along the way. This was a journey with barely any
          chance of survival. All of them knew this, and they were fully ready

          She hadn&#8217;t shown herself once though. Hearing this, she
          couldn&#8217;t help inwardly sighing. The expression on her face only
          turned complicated when she thought of an ancient secret. Soon after,
          she said to Lin Wu, &#8220;Take everyone and leave after you saved
          your beloved.&#8221;

          Judging from the events that had happened during this period, he could
          tell that she was so focused on the safety of Sky Deer City that she
          even went to the Boundary Marker Sea in person. She does not plan to
          escape to safety even if her life was in danger. Her great kindness
          and virtue in doing anything she could for the sake of the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains and its people made him admire her a lot.
          He thought that no one would be able to repay her for her grace.</span

          powerless.</span

          from the end of the universe. The force was so huge and unparalleled
          that it seemed as if another world had crashed onto their. This was
          the World Force from the Boundary Marker Sea. Supposedly, one wave
          could be composed of broken ancient worlds and universes, and even
          small worlds could be seen rolling and floating in it.</span

          the sky, hovering between heaven and earth. Countless experts had
          fallen here, and the grievances of the dead enveloped the world in a
          grey mist. On the cliff in the distance, three blurry figures could be
          standing there as light and shadow faded. They looked like they were
          separated by an ancient universe.</span

          he saw the young man from a distance, still with that blank and
          indifferent expression as he stood above them all. He had on white
          clothes as clean and spotless as snow, and his extraordinary and
          refined aura was that of a fairy from the heavens. His whole body was
          shrouded in divine light surrounded by Chaos Qi. Just by standing
          there, he seemed to be the centre of the universe. Not even the void
          could withstand his presence.</span

          off an unparalleled sense of tranquillity. Despite looking like an
          Immortal, Gu Changge was cruel and dispassionate in his ways, which
          made people fear him to the bone. The mighty waves from the Boundary
          Marker Sea crashed, but they collapsed into ashes scattered in the air
          behind him.</span

          Upon seeing this, Lin Wu felt his anger rise, and even his eyes seemed
          to be on the verge of shooting out flames as he glared at Gu Changge.
          &#8220;I&#8217;ve come as you told me to. What more do you

          be smashed to pieces?&#8221; Gu Changge smiled and nonchalantly
          thought out loud while he hinted that Ah Da could do as he instructed
          at any time. A terrifying wind swept from under the cliff then. Not
          only the younger generation but even the older generation who were in
          the Sacred Lord Realm did not dare to approach it.</span

          no match for Ah Da, who was in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm. He only had to
          thrust a palm forward to send everyone flying backwards, causing them
          to cough up blood. They also almost exploded because of the attack.
          Even if they had two Sacred Emperor Realm experts with them, they
          still didn&#8217;t stand a chance. They ended up being flung upside
          down as they got soaked in the blood they coughed up.</span

          his whole body was torn apart and almost turned into powder.
          Fortunately, the phantom of a True Dragon appeared to surge from his
          blood and seemed to revive him at the critical moment. Ancient energy
          then rose up and quickly healed his injuries. Still, the damage he
          sustained was so serious that he had already lost his ability to
          fight.</span

          took a glance at Lin Wu. He then inquisitively turned to look at the
          white-clad lady. [I knew a big fish would come, but this one is really
          big. Judging from the fluctuation of energy from that attack just now,
          she has surpassed the strength of an average True Daoist. There aren’t
          many True Daoists left in the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.
          Furthermore, this one is a woman.]</span

          in white in front of him. Brilliant runes like fragmented gold flashed
          in her eyes. As they were crushed by the movement of the Great Dao,
          the rumbling of thunder could be heard from within the void.</span

          injured Lin Wu and the others before she waved a hand and she spoke
          impassively, &#8220;He who is unjust is doomed to destruction. Knowing

          Dao energy.</span

          Changge. In this universe, there were many stars that seemed like they
          could change with just her thought and turn into various divine
          abilities.

          quest to kill me. It is an honour. Truly. But, where did that
          confidence of yours come from? Is it because you defeated and killed a
          True Daoist from some Ancient Royal Family in front of Sky Deer

          forward, and a thick but incomparably sharp Sword Qi, like an endless
          mountain piercing through the universe. Brilliant and invisible, it
          faintly shone when it suddenly slashed forward. Stars all over the sky
          began to explode and turn into ashes. They all turned into fine powder
          due to the aftermath of the Sword Qi.</span

          slightly waved, shooting out one Sword Qi after another. His attack
          was simple and straightforward. The Sword Qi pierced through outer
          space, illuminating the deep and cold universe and cutting down the
          runes, turning them into ash. Even the golden pages quickly
          dimmed.</span

          Wastelands and Ten Domains or the Upper Realm. However, she had never
          seen such an unbelievable genius like Gu Changge. He was only in his
          early twenties, and yet he was already in the First-Order
          Quasi-Nirvana Realm. He didn&#8217;t even falter from fighting with

          Her beauty was peerless and sacred, and it even made the sky appear
          pale. The sight of her was enough to stun any living being in this

          territories. Compared to living in Sky Deer City alone, you will have
          much, much more freedom. If you don&#8217;t want to, I happen to need
          a concubine. If you allow me to enter Sky Deer City, I promise you a

          sky, seemingly able to penetrate the universe. It was condensed with

          pierce through her golden pages.</span

          dispelling Gu Changge&#8217;s technique. At the same time, the
          lingering prestige remained undiminished as it continued to charge
          ahead.</span

          didn&#8217;t dare to face her attack head-on, and so he had to
          retreat. On the other hand, the Chaos Qi that Sky Deer Goddess shot
          out turned into a fair hand big enough to cover the sky before it
          slapped down on him. Ah Da, who had already been ordered by Gu
          Changge, naturally did not hesitate to let go of Lu Luo as he quickly
          retreated in the other direction. Sky Deer Goddess quickly rolled up
          her sleeves and pulled Lu Luo to her.</span

          brilliant divine light between her brows, and her fairy-like body was

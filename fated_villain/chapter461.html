          dumbfounded expression. Just now, he thought that Lu Luo was probably
          just mentioning this because of the resentment she held towards Sky
          Deer City. That she was not being serious. However, looking at her
          eyes, a wave of horror rushed into him, shaking his heart. He could
          not believe his ears. If he were to surrender to the Upper Realm and

          person of great status and was loved by all. Countless admired her,
          and her name was unparalleled in the world. But now, she was just a
          miserable prisoner in the dungeon of a rival force. She was even
          contemplating betraying the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. [When

          you&#8217;ve already seen a glimpse of his strength. He is around the
          same age as you, yet he is at least in the Sacred King Realm. Whereas

          dumbfounded but then quickly interrupted her with a wave of his hand.
          His face welled up with pain and regret, not being able to let Lu Luo
          continue. He really didn&#8217;t expect that he would get such an
          answer after leaving Sky Deer City and travelling such a long way,

          so that I could be at peace with standing on the side of
          righteousness. She did this so that I would not feel guilty even if I
          end up not being able to save her from death. In the end, you’re
          prepared to sacrifice yourself for my sake, huh? Foolish girl. How

          >The conversation between Lin Wu and Luo Luo within the dungeon had
          reached Gu Changge&#8217;s ears. He hadn&#8217;t expected Lu Luo to
          say this to Lin Wu. However, it could only be said that Lu Luo knew
          Lin Wu better than he did. Thus, she knew how to persuade him. From
          this point of view, the more guilt Lin Wu had in his heart towards Luo
          Luo, the easier it would be to control him.</span

          that? Well, guess you have thought it through. Do you intend to
          surrender to us?&#8221; Gu Changge walked over and opened the cell
          door with a faint smile on his face.

          the moment he was forcefully suppressing it. At this time, if he were

          intentions go to waste.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With a wave of spatial fluctuation, Lin Wu appeared in a magnificent
          and ancient palace in the next moment. The place was filled with
          spiritual energy, with the divine light from treasures and various
          godly weapons hanging on the walls. It appeared glorious and noble. On
          both sides of the palace, there was also a group of beautiful maids in
          attendance, all peerless beauties.

          and natural, as he smiled and gestured for Lin Wu to speak. Lin Wu
          looked around and saw that there was indeed no one else there.</span

          Otherwise, she would not have made such a choice. He knew Lu
          Luo&#8217;s character well, and knew that when she said those words,
          she must have hated it so much to the point that she would rather die
          and end this torment and pain. But here, she wasn’t even the one in
          control of her own life and death. She was completely under Gu
          Changge&#8217;s control.</span

          benefits of things so that she will understand what she should
          do.&#8221; Gu Changge shook his head slightly and brought the white
          jade wine cup to his lips, taking a casual sip.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;What do you propose she should do? Is it for her to betray the
          Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains?&#8221; As soon as Lin Wu heard this,
          he couldn&#8217;t help his anger from surging. His teeth were
          clenched. He simply wanted to pulverise Gu Changge and shred him into
          a million pieces.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next moment, a terrifying pressure swept down, causing Lin
          Wu&#8217;s expression to shift drastically as a chill fiercely
          enveloped his entire body. His legs went limp immediately afterward,
          unable to withstand the pressure, and he fell directly to his knees
          with a thud, incomparably humiliated. Even his flesh was about to
          explode to pieces, producing cracked blood marks.</span

          cold indifference did not make the slightest ripple.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;You…” Lin Wu was in complete rage, his eyes were glowing red.
          He had never been so humiliated in all his life. Even in his most
          mediocre days, he had never been treated like this before. Even so,
          the terrifying pressure seemed to weigh down a hundred thousand
          mountains on his shoulders, making it impossible for him to even lift
          his head. His once terrifying Talent, his powerful bloodline and even
          the mysterious Martial Arts Space could not hold any significant
          effect in the face of absolute strength. This insurmountable and
          terrifying gap caused Lin Wu to feel despair and powerlessness once
          again.</span

          Lin Wu eventually quickly suppressed his anger, took a deep breath and
          calmed down. He opened his mouth and directly stated his intentions,
          not wanting to leave Lu Luo to endure this alone.</span

          Naturally, she will enjoy the benefits of being under us. It’s just,
          she has not pledged her allegiance yet. Do you mean that you are going
          to deliver this pledge of allegiance for her?&#8221; Gu Changge raised
          his eyebrows slightly, before asking with a natural expression.</span

          Changge smiled faintly and said, as if he was not talking about
          attacking the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, but just something
          trivial.</span

          >The barrier outside Sky Deer City has basically been the core
          protection of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains for countless
          years. It was said that there were nine sub-arrays forming this grand
          array, which produced this barrier. There were eight sub-arrays that
          formed a hexagram and the last sub-array at the centre of the
          hexagram. Naturally, each of these sub-arrays had their own Array
          Core. It did not really matter which one, as long was one of the nine
          was opened, a small gap would open up in the grand array, which would
          all the Upper Realm forces to invade and start a massacre.

          pallor. He had actually guessed Gu Changge&#8217;s intentions long
          ago, and that it would have to do with breaching Sky Deer City. All
          along, he just couldn’t believe that his target would actually be the
          Array Core. It could even be said that the Array Cores were the
          foundation for the survival of the city. If even one was opened, then
          it would only be a matter of time before Sky Deer City would be
          breached.</span

          behind it would be like ordinary people who had removed their armour
          and thrown away their swords. They would be powerless to resist. Faced
          with a terrifying army from the Upper Realm, how could the Eight
          Wastelands and Ten Domains resist?</span

          calm down, his heart suddenly wavering a little. Even if he could do
          it, it would be like opening the door for the army of the Upper Realm
          to drive straight in. Such a betrayal would be even more shameful and
          outrageous than bringing his people to surrender to the Upper
          Realm.</span

          Array Core is located? Don’t take me for a fool. The Sky Deer Goddess
          should also have an heir or disciple or something. Perhaps, you have
          even seen this person with your own eyes. Now, you still dare to say

          down his forehead, causing the clothes on his back to become wet. He
          hadn&#8217;t forgotten the difference in strength between himself and
          Gu Changge. Even if he wanted to, he wouldn&#8217;t even be able to
          make a move. Gu Changge could kill him a million times over before he

          the same time, he reached out and waved his hand across empty air, and
          a burst of golden light emerged. This light soon formed ancient
          forbidden characters, which landed on Lin Wu&#8217;s forehead.</span

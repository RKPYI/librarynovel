          Her countenance initially perplexed and muddled, before eventually
          settling into a serene and lucid state. Her mind felt like a chaotic
          vortex, filled with an array of surreal and peculiar visions.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her visions converged, coalescing into a single point of light. The
          woman in white visibly relaxed. Thousands of lights shimmered in her
          eyes, like countless sparkling shards.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As she softly murmured to herself, the ancient runes between her
          eyebrows shone brilliantly akin to a tiny rising sun, before gradually
          fading away. With each passing moment, she appeared increasingly
          ethereal and otherworldly.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The air around her fluctuated as countless enigmatic lines from
          unknown dimensions weaved together. It was a profound and mystical
          power that seemed to transcend time, space, and even destiny itself. A
          wealth of memory fragments emerged from the depths of her soul, like a
          treasure trove that had been sealed away for ages.</span

          karma?”</span

          she would have remained in the Sanctum of Destiny, dutifully carrying
          out her responsibilities. However, with the collapse of the Immortal
          Palace, it became a forbidden era, buried in the River of Time.
          Countless eons had since passed, yet even she remained bound by the
          fated karma that was set in motion during that time.</span

          >“Much like a fish forever bound to its river, I too, find it
          challenging to escape the pull of my destiny.” Her words held a depth
          of meaning known only to her, and her countenance reflected a complex
          mix of emotions.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Countless threads emerged in front of Xiao Ruoyin. Some shimmered
          like silver, while others were as black as ink, and a selected few
          were sparkled like gold. Each thread emitted a radiant and luminous
          glow, illuminating the palace with a breathtaking radiance.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >These Threads of Destiny were all connected to someone, intertwining
          their fates together. She reached out, wanting to touch the threads,
          but her fingers passed through them. The threads began to blur before
          slowly dissipating into nothingness, as if they had never existed in
          the first place.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As someone with a Nihility Destiny Phyqisue, all the Threads of
          Destiny she touched would inevitably dissolve into nothingness. It was
          a power that made it difficult for her to connect to anything related
          to destiny and even more challenging to intertwine with someone
          else’s. As long as Xiao Ruoyin willed it, she could erase herself from
          the memories of all who knew her, leaving no trace of her existence
          behind.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the midst of all the threads, one stood out with an unparalleled
          thickness. With hue as dark as the deepest night, it refused to fade
          into nothingness like the others. This particular thread of destiny
          seemed to transcend time itself, weaving its way through the ages and
          connecting to this very moment in history.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin was not surprised by the thread at all. She merely sighed
          softly and withdrew her hand. Despite her power, a searing pain
          coursed through her when her palm came into contact with this
          particular Thread of Destiny, accompanied by black smoke. This was no
          ordinary karmic connect. It was something she could not erase even if
          she wanted to.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Gu Changge… That’s his name now?” Xiao Ruoyin murmured the name
          softly. Her face was calm and composed, exuding an air of elegance and
          sophistication that almost seemed otherworldly. Memories began
          flooding her mind, causing her to crease her brow.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Her recollection of events prior to her current existence came
          naturally to her. The disparity between her present self and her
          former self was not significant. The most notable dissimilarity was
          that she had regained her memories of being the High Priestess of
          Destiny and had also awakened her Nihility Destiny Physique.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Even so, Xiao Ruoyin’s past twenty years of memories no longer held
          sway over her present self. She was fully aware of all the events as
          well as all the thoughts and decisions made by her former self in
          order to attach herself to Gu Changge. After all, they were the same
          person. Although she did not agree with her actions, she could no
          longer do anything to the past.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Gu Changge probably kept me by his side because he already knew of
          my identity… It appears that he is just waiting for me to awaken to my
          physique. I must not let him know that I have already regained my
          memory as the High Priestess of Destiny…”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin furrowed her brow, deep in thought as she pondered her
          next move. Memories flashed through her mind. She was far more
          informed now than her former self, even with knowledge of Gu Changge’s
          terrifying origins.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If it weren’t for that unbreakable Thread of Destiny, Xiao Ruoyin
          might not be able to uncover this information. Gu Changge was the one
          who caused her to reincarnate, so naturally his true identity was now
          ripe for discovery. With utmost certainty, Xiao Ruoyin knew that this
          was the inevitable truth.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She couldn’t comprehend how such a powerful and invincible existence
          like Gu Changge ended up reincarnating just like her. Nevertheless,
          she could not afford to ponder over such matters at present. Gu
          Changge must have regained his past memories very early on. This was
          the only plausible explanation for his meteoric rise to power in just
          two decades.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin clearly understood Gu Changge’s immense strength.
          Although she had awakened to her past memories and her Physique, going
          against Gu Changge remained a lofty and unattainable goal.</span
        >

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          reaching enlightenment… I must not let him succeed. Now that peace has
          finally been restored to the world, must it be ravaged by him once
          more?”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Xiao Ruoyin let out a soft sigh as she finally made sense of
          everything. The weight of her predicament was far greater than she had
          anticipated upon awakening to the memories of her previous life.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At present, her most viable option appeared to be either delaying the
          inevitable or devising an escape from Gu Changge. Both paths presented
          significant challenges, especially in the presence of her Master, Yan
          Ji, who was appointed by Gu Changge to keep a watchful eye on her
          every move. If she was acting suspiciously, Gu Changge would
          immediately notice it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Before this, Xiao Ruoyin always thought Yan Ji’s actions were purely
          out of kindness. With newfound clarity, she realized that Gu Changge
          had ulterior motives from the moment he reached out to her. It was now
          evident that everything was a carefully crafted trap, set by
          him.</span

          >Xiao Ruoyin’s aura gradually shifted. The haze that surrounded her
          dissipated, and her body gradually took on a more solid form, until
          she looked like her usual self. She walked out of the chamber, and
          gazed at the bustling streets of Dark Kun City, now teeming with life
          and activity.</span

          sky was a vibrant shade of blue, adorned with fluffy white clouds and

          >Upon hearing Gu Changge’s instruction, Gu Xianer quickly grabbed onto
          his sleeve and said, “I’m not leaving, I’m staying here…”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge frowned at her, but she met his eyes with a hard stare and
          muttered softly, “Unless you come with me.”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She realized that the Cursed Rock posed a great danger, so the best
          course of action was to leave the area as soon as possible, but she
          could not be at ease if Gu Changge stayed here.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Stop fooling around. I’ll be fine.” Gu Changge understood Gu
          Xianer’s concern. He shook his head lightly and made her let go.
          Turning to Ah Da again, he instructed, “Take her and the others away
          from this place.”</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Very well, Master.” Taking Gu Xianer and the others away from here
          was no challenge for a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert like Ah Da.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Xianer shot Gu Changge a resentful look, miffed that he had tore
          her hand off him. Despite her irritation, she complied with his
          request and departed without causing any further commotion. She rarely
          saw Gu Changge showing such a guarded expression.</span

          >The remaining Sect Masters, Elders, Family Heads also instructed the
          younger generations to withdraw to safety, sensing the imminent danger
          of this place. Only a handful of young prodigies like the King with
          Six Crowns, Yu Feiya, Chosen Monk Jin Chan and An Xi chose to stay
          behind. These skillful experts were unafraid of any harm coming their
          way.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In just an instant, the bustling street fell silent again. The
          remaining divine rocks were swiftly taken away by several ancient
          beings.</span

          >*Buzz!!* The Daoist Artifacts hovering above the sky shook as they
          attempted to suppress the Cursed Rock with strands of Nirvana Realm
          Principles. However, just as they were about to make contact with the
          rock’s surface, they were abruptly repelled and dispersed like
          ripples. Despite this, their frightening force continued to surge
          outward like a powerful wave, prompting the other ancient beings to
          rush in and neutralize it to prevent any further damage to the
          surrounding area.</span

          >“Could the entity within this Cursed Rock have surpassed the Nirvana
          Realm…?” One of the Sect Masters wondered aloud. A golden rune glowed
          in his eye as he tried to catch a glimpse of what was inside the rock
          through the crack on its surface.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Suddenly, a beam of dark light shot out of it from the crevice,
          striking the Sect Master’s eye with speed faster than lightning. A
          blood-curdling scream escaped his lips as he instantly disintegrated
          into ash leaving nothing behind.</span

          >The scene shook everyone on the streets. They felt a chill down their
          backs as fear grew even more in them. That dark light had easily
          obliterated a Sect Master who was at least a Sacred Emperor expert,
          annihilating both his body and soul.</span
        >

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >If there was a godly weapon concealed within this Cursed Rock, it
          undoubtedly surpassed the Sacred Emperor Grade. The Daoist Artifacts
          could barely contain its power. Although it had yet to awaken fully,
          it was clear that this entity was both strange and frightening.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Rumble!!* A massive dark demonic cloud rolled into the eastern sky
          of Dark Kun City. Terrifying silhouettes loomed within it, their wings
          adorned with vibrant feathers that swayed in the wind.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Are they from Devil Mountain?” The faces of many Sect Masters
          contorted with fear and apprehension at the sight of the cloud. The
          arrival of the black demonic cloud also stirred up unease and alarm
          among cultivators and other inhabitants of Dark Kun City.</span

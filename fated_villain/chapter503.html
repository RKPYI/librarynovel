        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So this is the Land of Rebirth that is deep beneath Sky Deer City. It
                appears someone has relocated them with some sort of powerful divine ability.&#8221;</span><span
                id="more-31096"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to its state when the Sky Deer Goddess last visited, it seemed
                completely different. The sky was dim as not much light was to be found, with sparse mist floating in
                the sky. At first sight, one would notice the terrifyingly bottomless pit with fathomless depth. Its
                area was notably larger than that of many stars. In certain regions, one could even see the deep holes
                left behind by the remnant fragments of stars.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had she not discovered that the region&#8217;s strange World Principles was
                the same as when she last visited, she would have assumed that she had come to the wrong place. </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Sky Deer City was taken, the Upper Realm army stormed in and occupied
                various regions. Formidable cultivators of different forces of Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains could
                only flee or submit.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time after that, Sky Deer City, as the first city of Eight Wastelands
                and Ten Domains the Upper Realm occupied, was divided among forces according to their battle strategy.
                And now, order in the city was restored as they were already strategising the next steps of their
                conquest.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sky Deer City&#8217;s fall was equivalent to the gates of Eight Wastelands
                and Ten Domains being open. Therefore, Immortal or formidable forces were now planning to dispatch their
                respective troops to attack various clans of the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, since there was no
                longer a need for a combined assault as what they did previously.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the forces of the Upper Realm, those in the Eight Wastelands and Ten
                Domains bore not the slightest threat as their army could swiftly bring them to peril.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge was more interested in the Land of Rebirth, which was in
                the depths of Sky Deer City, hence he had the Sky Deer Goddess bring him over.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, he was disappointed by what he saw now.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[We were too late. Something is indeed hidden within Sky Deer City&#8217;s
                Land of Rebirth. I can even detect some Power of Reincarnation.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge gazed afar with his fascinated eyes before turning into a divine
                rainbow to venture into the deeper areas.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area was limitlessly vast, resembling an unknown universe. Nevertheless,
                what caught Gu Changge by surprise was the abundant aura of death wafting in the air, as though the
                entire area had withered. There were even signs of battles in certain spots, though they were so old it
                was as if it had persisted since ancient times.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than that, there were shattered steles scattered all over the ebony
                soil, with no Life Force could be drawn within. Between the chunks of gravel, one could even see a river
                of blood flowing underground.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Back when the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains split from the Upper Realm, a
                portion of the Upper Realm&#8217;s Fortuity was stripped away as well, leading to the Principles not
                being complete during this epoch. As the Great Dao is incomplete, no Immortals could be born, even till
                this day. But to see traces of Principles from the Upper Realm lingering here, perhaps the stolen
                Fortuity is indeed related to this region.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge then stepped forward and saw a black sun at the edge.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The black sun seemed rather withered, as though someone had once taken it
                away, and whatever light remaining seemed bleak. In fact, the light seemed to contain some Life Force in
                it, but they were too scarce and insignificant to do anything to the vast Land of Rebirth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Gu Changge&#8217;s opinion, the supreme experts of Sky Deer City must have
                seized the light with some powerful divine ability when they were making their escape. Evidently, they
                were too hasty, and were unable to thoroughly remove all traces in the region.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The light obviously harboured faint Spiritual Energy as well. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[From all these points, it&#8217;s obvious that the Land of Rebirth is hiding
                something deeply related to Reincarnation.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The corpses that were buried here have all disappeared.&#8221; The Sky
                Deer Goddess came over from another direction, and she was having a hard time trying to suppress her
                emotions. She went looking for the corpses of the supreme experts that had died in the war against the
                Upper Realm, which were buried in the region. Sadly, all she found were empty coffins with no bodies
                inside.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her heart trembled as she subconsciously guessed that the deaths in the war
                were merely a guise. Seeing how those clans would go through great lengths to fake trivial matters and
                deceive the entire Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains, she realised she had underestimated those from the
                clans.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s move on. There&#8217;s no point dwelling in it. It appears
                Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains hold more secrets than you yourself know,&#8221; Gu Changge claimed
                with a subtle grin.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sky Deer Goddess then nodded as her eyes grew complex. [If it weren&#8217;t
                for the Upper Realm&#8217;s attack, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have discovered this for all my life. Am I
                blessed or cursed?]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, outside the Land of Rebirth, there were already individuals
                waiting in reverence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were individuals of great power, Elders who voluntarily submitted to the
                Upper Realm, with each possessing formidable cultivation levels. At least, they were much stronger than
                the True Daoists of the Four Powerful War God Clans who pretended to be ready to fight the war till
                death.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Elders&#8217; cultivation power was now sealed by the formidable
                experts from the various forces, with unique runes that were not to be used carelessly. Even so, their
                Qi and vitality was not to be underestimated as ordinary individuals still couldn&#8217;t carelessly
                approach them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, they were now lowly prisoners, and were being watched by the
                cultivators surrounding them. Even so, when they requested to meet with Gu Changge, no one disallowed
                it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings, Young Master Changge.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They briefly glanced at the Sky Deer Goddess with perturbed faces before
                greeting Gu Changge respectfully.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh? For what reason have you come to me?&#8221; Gu Changge turned to
                them with a somewhat surprised look. He was still considering how he should deal with the True Daoists
                of Sky Deer City, who had surrendered—whether to devour them to feed himself, or to let them live to
                serve him. After all, now that the entire world had witnessed him subduing the True Daoists of the Four
                Powerful War God Clans, if the Elders were to disappear, unwanted suspicion would be drawn upon
                him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, that didn&#8217;t mean Gu Changge would let them off so
                easily. He just simply disdained the hassle.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know a little about the secret within the Land of Rebirth.&#8221;
                In response, the Elders hid nothing as they intended to negotiate the terms with Gu Changge to alleviate
                their punishment as war prisoners.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Land of Rebirth? It must have been stolen from the Upper Realm in
                the past. It wasn&#8217;t hard to figure that out.&#8221; Gu Changge revealed a faint smile.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless years ago, the separation between the Upper Realm and Eight
                Wastelands and Ten Domains might have been related to the Demon Lord&#8217;s annihilating the world, but
                it shouldn&#8217;t be relevant to the theft of the Upper Realm&#8217;s Fortuity.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Elders peered at one another with a bitter grin. They knew
                that they wouldn&#8217;t be able to hide the matter from Gu Changge. Though, the information they
                intended to disclose wasn&#8217;t that, but the secrets beneath the Land of Rebirth.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is said that underneath the Land of Rebirth, there is a Tree of
                Epoch. The Tree of Epoch has lived through numerous epochs. Although its Life Force continues to
                dwindle, it never dies. A few epochs ago, someone noticed that the Tree of Epoch was extracting young
                sprouts to grow new branches.&#8221; The Elders spoke and revealed a secret that was known by
                none.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Tree of Epoch?&#8221; Gu Changge tensed his brows.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tree of Epoch, the World Tree, and the Tree of Spacetime were mysterious
                ancient trees that were widely fabled in the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, Gu Changge owned a World Tree seedling, and it was now
                growing it in his Inner Universe, but it would still take a long time until it bloomed with potent
                branches and leaves.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tree of Epoch was a mysterious ancient tree that could easily thrive
                through numerous epochs. There were claims that one could travel through the River of Time to the past
                and future by climbing along the leaves on the Tree of Epoch.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially, the Spacetime Stone, the Mirror of Wonders, and the Tree of
                Epoch were different instruments with the same function. Though, the Tree of Epoch was ultimately an
                entity that belonged to fables as none had ever seen it. Even in the Upper Realm, there were barely any
                records about it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[If that’s the case, is the region actually harbouring the new-grown Tree of
                Epoch? But if it is the Tree of Epoch, those below Immortal Realm wouldn&#8217;t be able to approach it,
                so how did the cultivators manage to transport it? How peculiar. It mustn&#8217;t be the complete Tree
                of Epoch.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge donned a pondering look, unbothered by the fact that the Elders
                might be lying to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The withered Tree of Epoch must have turned into a seed or a sprout. Perhaps
                a fruit? If that’s the case, the Tree of Epoch certainly pertains to the Fortuity of the entire
                world.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back when the Upper Realm was &#8216;robbed,&#8217; its Fortuity massively
                decreased, leading to incomplete Heavenly Way. And so, the already-fractured World Principles grew more
                incapable of containing the power of the Immortal Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[So that is why no one can reach the Immortal Realm in the Upper Realm.] Gu
                Changge subconsciously squinted his eyes as a daring thought arose in his mind.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Tree of Epoch&#8217;s influence was so great, it would definitely
                affect the Fortuity changes in the Upper Realm, so were he to absorb the tree, he just might be able to
                conquer the entire Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, &#8216;to conquer&#8217; wasn&#8217;t referring to literally
                conquering the Upper Realm, but gaining control over how one could step into the Immortal Realm while in
                the Upper Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to reach the Immortal Realm, a cultivator would have to be baptised
                by the lights of Immortality.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, without Gu Changge&#8217;s permission, none in the world could ever
                reach the Immortal Realm.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, currently, he was still uncertain about the whereabouts and what was
                left of the so-called Tree of Epoch.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time later, the Upper Realm Army set up camp in an ancient city that
                covered a million square kilometres within Sky Deer City. This space was divided among different forces.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rifts could be seen appearing in the sky every day as the vast army was
                marching towards regions across Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, in the eyes of many, the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were a
                scrumptious steak on a chopping board. Naturally, it was especially so for the Ten Great Domains, which
                were spacious and filled with fertile lands. Therefore, the army of different forces could be seen
                hurrying over every single day.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to its isolated, abandoned state countless years ago, where exiles
                were tossed over to this land, the current Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains were remarkably richer in
                resources.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the flames of war spread, battle cries thundered across regions. Large
                armies stampeded through the land, as though they were a raging torrent that was to flood the people of
                the Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains with hopelessness and disasters.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, those of the younger generation such as the King with Six
                Crowns, the Phoenix Lady, and the Sky Demon Sovereign returned to the Upper Realm after the army had
                broken through the defences of Sky Deer City instead of participating in the further ventures.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To them, the great war was merely a training session. Once the session ended,
                they naturally returned to the Upper Realm and put all their focus on cultivating.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, Gu Xianer left without bidding farewell to Gu Changge nor
                informing him about it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After knowing about that, Gu Changge merely chuckled without minding
                it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Gu Xianer, the great war was quite an effective means to train. Although
                her current strength wasn&#8217;t that different from the other strongest among the younger generation,
                she wasn&#8217;t exactly satisfied with it just yet.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon, Gu Changge&#8217;s cultivation level grew by leaps and bounds. When he
                was secretly dealing with the True Daoists of the Four Great Battle God Clans, they revealed a piece of
                information to him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, the ones who ordered the abandonment of Sky Deer City and the
                scattered retreat were the ancient beings behind them. These ancient beings possessed frightening
                identities, and their age could be traced back to when Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains came into
                existence.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, they had clearly escaped from Sky Deer City and returned to
                their bases. It was possible that they even relocated their bases.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the Upper Realm, Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains also had many
                Lower Realms. Given the ancient beings&#8217; capabilities, they could effortlessly open up a Space Rift
                to the Lower Realm and go into hiding.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was quite surprised by the news. However, he then thought of
                another candidate, or rather, an opportunity to annihilate the Four Powerful War God Clans. [If my
                assumption is right, it was the ancient beings of the Four Powerful War God Clans who relocated the Land
                of Rebirth.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, what do you want me to do now?&#8221; From outside the
                palace, Lin Wu walked over with a hideous scowl. Although he had betrayed the Eight Wastelands and Ten
                Domains, his treachery was done discreetly without exposing himself. At least, on the surface, none was
                aware of that.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, he was dragged over by the guards, as Gu Changge had a task
                for him.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he recently met Lu Luo, their situation only got better by a little.
                Essentially they had yet to regain their freedom. They were just being confined to the courtyard instead
                of the dungeon.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Lin Wu was disaffected by this, he could only contain his
                dissatisfaction as he dared not to show it.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have something else for you to deal with. Once that is finished,
                I&#8217;ll naturally release the two of you.&#8221; Carrying a faint smile, Gu Changge sat by the window
                as he gently blew his tea.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You’ve promised me that you wouldn&#8217;t hurt her. What more do you
                want?&#8221; Lin Wu spoke through gritted teeth as his fierce gaze was fixated on Gu Changge. Never once
                in his life was he this humiliated. Although he survived the great war, he wasn&#8217;t able to find
                peace. Every now and then, he would be haunted by immense guilt.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is simple. Help me find your clansmen.&#8221; Gu Changge casually
                grinned. &#8220;If you are unwilling to do so, then your previous effort may possibly be in vain.
                Don&#8217;t you forget, a certain young prodigy in my Family is still holding a grudge against
                you.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, you despicable scum…&#8221; Lin Wu was dazed for a moment
                before realising what Gu Changge was implying. Immediately, intense vexation surged in his heart as he
                tensely gritted his teeth, emitting a sound that bore his extreme exasperation.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easily, Lin Wu acknowledged that Gu Changge&#8217;s plan was indeed simple.
                Since none had yet to know about his betrayal against Sky Deer City, he could simply find an opportunity
                to return to his clan&#8217;s base.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If his guess was right, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood
                Dragon War God Clan must be looking for a way to flee from Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. As such, it
                was as clear as day that Gu Changge was planning to make a move on his clan.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Lin Wu understood that it would be too late even if he was to reject
                Gu Changge&#8217;s order. After being tricked by Gu Changge, he no longer had a choice. He could only
                keep on walking down the unrighteous path.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I offered you a chance. It does not matter to me whatever your choice
                is.&#8221; Gu Changge retained his leisurely grin in response before serenely blowing the tea in his
                cup, as if he wasn&#8217;t aware of Lin Wu&#8217;s resentment.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Wu&#8217;s entire body was shaking, and even his eyes grew red. His heart
                was full of fiery rage and unconcealable abhorrence. Yet, he didn&#8217;t dare to rebuke Gu Changge. It
                was as Gu Changge said, he no longer had a choice. He reached the point of no return the moment he
                betrayed Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But if you agree, I shall have my men transport you out of town right
                now. Rest assured, no one will notice you.” The faint smile persisted on Gu Changge&#8217;s face.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, are you not afraid that Karma will find you one day and
                demand respiration for your vile acts?&#8221; Lin Wu&#8217;s eyes grew incomparably icy. He felt that
                encountering Gu Changge was the most abysmal disaster of his life.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, Karma, huh? I can&#8217;t wait to see her,&#8221; Gu Changge said
                with a subtle grin as he was not at all bothered.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Wu&#8217;s value was his current identity as the most excellent young
                prodigy of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood Dragon War God Clan in recent years. His
                clan would definitely hate to leave him to suffer. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was aware that Lin Wu&#8217;s clan territory was now nothing but
                empty. Even so, he believed that Lin Wu surely had a way to come in contact with his other clansmen,
                which would help him save the time and effort for a search.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Lin Wu was a Fortuitous One, Gu Changge would indubitably wait for Lin
                Wu to reach his maximum potential until his final moments. Otherwise, his identity as a Fortuitous One
                would be a waste.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, in Gu Changge&#8217;s opinion, the Four Powerful War God Clans
                were much more valuable than other forces, as the person who stole the Fortuity of the Upper Realm might
                bear a close connection to the Four War God Clans.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from that, as Sky Deer City&#8217;s downfall deemed Eight Wastelands
                and Ten Domains vulnerable, Gu Changge now planned to tend to something else, Xiao Yang, the other
                Fortuitous One from the Family of Protectors.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the great war, not one member of that Family had appeared, which
                certainly took Gu Changge aback. Hypothetically, such a moment was an opportune time for a mighty hero
                to show up. Though, perhaps he was overthinking it. That or the so-called Family of Protectors was
                merely a dishonourable bunch like the Four Powerful War God Clans.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Perhaps I can finally use the secret pawns the Gu Family laid down in the
                Eight Wastelands and Ten Domains. Besides, Gu Wudi and Xiao Yang&#8217;s whereabouts have always been in
                my grasp.]</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge&#8217;s eyes gradually turned sinister.</span></p>

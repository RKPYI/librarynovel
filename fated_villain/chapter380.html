          looking down at the engraved stone closely. It was incomplete and
          ancient, yet seemed to contain a kind of strange energy as it emitted
          unique vibrations. The worn-out ancient runes looked mysterious as
          well, and she hadn&#8217;t expected the stone, which had fallen at her
          feet to be anything special.</span

          were plenty of cultivation opportunities here which belonged to no
          one. He might have noticed and pursued it all the way here first, but
          it was now in the hands of this girl. He couldn&#8217;t just demand it
          from her. Besides, he could sense that her cultivation level was very
          high, meaning that he couldn&#8217;t win against her. If he
          accidentally offended her, he might end up dead.</span

          something good, so I chased after it. I didn&#8217;t know that it was
          just a broken engraved stone.&#8221; After some thought, Jiang Chen
          smiled drily, a hint of pity and regret in his voice. He hoped that
          the girl had just picked it up out of curiosity and did not know what
          she was looking at. That way, he could simply pick it up when she
          abandoned it.</span

          before the bird on her shoulder meaningfully. It nodded frantically, a
          human-like excitement in its eyes, before looking at Jiang Chen with
          distaste. It could sense that this man, with a weak cultivation level,
          was planning to take the treasure from them.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[What?] Jiang Chen&#8217;s expression became stricken, instinctively
          activating his Qi to run away. At the same time, he drew a broken
          weapon from his sleeve, which transformed into light, trying to stop
          her from closing in on him.</span

          you!] Gu Xianer was pondering whether or not to attack when she saw
          the light shoot towards her. She froze, not expecting the weaker man
          to be brave enough to attack her. Her expression became furious from
          being slighted by someone this weak.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Rumble!* The void vibrated as she withdrew a shiny jade sword from
          her sleeve. Principles wove around it, the blade was surprisingly
          sharp as it cut through the void and attacked the fleeing man. Even if
          he had fled in advance, he was still vastly inferior to her. Almost
          instantly, the powerful jade sword had sliced through the air and
          reached its destination. A coldness swept over him as the sword was
          about to kill him; he turned deathly pale as fear encompassed
          him.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[Why is she so powerful!?] He became desperate. Just in time, a
          golden spear shot down from the sky, infinitely long and powerful, and
          blocked the attack.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[So useless. How can you let your treasure get stolen by someone
          else?] The golden-haired youth from the Godly Illusion Clan landed on
          the ground. His eyes were gold, and even the ends of his hair
          shimmered brightly with the colour. His sharp gaze lingered on him
          coldly before landing on Gu Xianer.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen, after narrowly escaping death, was bathed in a cold sweat
          as he collapsed on the ground while panting. He hadn&#8217;t expected
          this ethereal-looking girl to behave so violently and even attempted
          to kill him. If Jiang Ming had come a moment later, he would have died
          instantly. He didn&#8217;t mind the mocking words as he was too
          traumatised to be bothered by it. However, he became calmer while
          looking at the murderous-looking girl. He knew exactly how powerful
          the Godly Illusion Clan was, so this mysterious girl wouldn&#8217;t
          continue her attack if she knew better.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So you are the one who stole his treasure.&#8221; Jiang Ming
          studied Gu Xianer carefully, a look of amazement crossing his
          features. His Clansmen all consisted of attractive men and women, but
          this was the first time he had seen such otherworldly beauty on a
          young girl no less. His tone, however, remained cold and
          haughty.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Xianer ran up from behind, her skirts fluttering while her hair
          fell around her face like a waterfall. Her expression was frigid when
          she glanced at him after hearing him speak. This youth was extremely
          strong. She could tell he was partially in the Quasi-Sacred Realm, and
          was close to a breakthrough to the Sacred Realm. Nonetheless, she
          didn&#8217;t care about that though; she didn&#8217;t mind killing
          anyone who stood in her way.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Ming&#8217;s expression darkened when he saw that she was
          ignoring him. He was a young prodigy of the Godly Illusion Clan and
          his sister, Jiang Luoshen, was extraordinarily strong. He hadn&#8217;t
          been so underestimated before.</span

          let you live. Otherwise, no one can save you,&#8221; Jiang Ming said
          coldly. His terrifying spear shimmered with bright golden runes. He
          had seen that she was alone even though she was in the dangerous tomb,
          which meant she wouldn&#8217;t did not possess a grand status nor
          background.</span

          >&#8220;You sure are so egotistical and reckless.&#8221; Gu Xianer
          frowned, thinking that this youth was very proud. The way he was
          looking at her made her uncomfortable as well. However, since he was
          so bent on dying, she shouldn&#8217;t be blamed for this.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >She attacked immediately and forcefully, a frightening aura appearing
          around her. Her jade-white fist, delicate as it was, crossed the space
          between them to hit Jiang Ming. It made a loud thump as it shattered
          the void, and light exploded around them. The vibrations spread into
          the surrounding land, causing mountains to collapse and trees to
          become ash. The cultivators fighting each other for treasures looked
          simultaneously towards the direction it had come from.</span

          >&#8220;You dare attack me!? You must be suicidal!&#8221; Jiang Ming
          hadn&#8217;t expected her to attack so quickly. He became enraged and
          a vicious expression showed on his face as he retaliated. A golden
          light wove around him to form a frightening golden demeanour which
          rose into the sky. He then whipped his spear with the strength of a
          million tonnes towards Gu Xianer, glowing golden as it moved.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Bang!* Her expression didn&#8217;t change, remaining as cold as ever
          while she countered the spear attack with her jade fist. She looked
          slender and delicate but her strength was formidable. Her aura and
          vitality were strong, and there seemed to be a blood dragon surging
          from the top of her skull.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Many cultivators some distance away looked stricken by fear as they
          sensed the aura from the fight. Their souls seemed shaken by it. It
          even caused a few Sect Masters to frown.</span

          turned upside down. Infinite Principles and runes interwove and
          eventually condensed before a figure flew backwards. His hair became
          mussed while blood dripped from the corner of his mouth.</span

          >&#8220;IS that all you&#8217;ve got? Disappointing.&#8221; Gu Xianer
          walked towards him, her voice light while her clothes fluttered around
          her. She looked as ethereal and otherworldly as a goddess from the
          Nine Heavens, yet her abilities and strength shocked those near
          them.</span

          stopping. He had become weaker after just one attack and his arm felt
          numb. He couldn&#8217;t believe that while she had used her body to
          block his weapon, it had been his weapon which made a cracking sound,
          as if it was about to shatter. [Just how tough is her body!?]

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >[I refuse to believe I cannot take her down!] He gritted his teeth
          and planned to attack once more. He was unrivalled among his peers in
          the Godly Illusion Clan, so how could this random girl he had just met
          in the tomb possess such power?
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His body glowed with a terrifying golden light, making him look like
          a golden deity while exuding power over a five thousand kilometre
          radius. The void blurred due to the power he exuded, ready to melt
          under the temperature. This was an ability unique to the Godly
          Illusion Clan. It was the Godly Illusion Flame. It was ranked among
          the highest in the Heavenly Flames of the Upper Realm because of how
          potent it was.</span

          Jiang Ming, having displayed his ability, sliced his spear towards
          her. The void exploded from the force, emitting light as blinding as
          exploding stars as he attacked. At the same time, his eyes glowed with
          a bright golden light while the Godly Illusion Flame transformed into
          a golden dragon and descended from the sky. It burned everything in
          its path, sending fear through everyone nearby.</span

          materialised like a flower blooming. Each petal of the flower
          glittered like jade and contained a chilling murderous aura which
          swirled and billowed in the void, and each one could easily cut

          epicentre. The other young prodigies watched on in shock, but the

          >[What&#8217;s Jiang Ming doing? I told him to protect Jiang Chen but
          he&#8217;s fighting with someone?] Jiang Luoshen was watching the
          change within the ancient palace closely, and her brows furrowed when
          she noticed the vibrations from the fight. A hint of frigidness
          flashed across her cold features but her attention remained mostly on
          the ancient palace, and the crack emitting multicoloured light. She
          was confident in Jiang Ming&#8217;s ability and wasn&#8217;t worried
          that he would get wounded.</span

          >A sudden scream then rang out. It scared the young prodigies and
          cultivators closely observing the fight. As the golden light faded
          away, they could see Jiang Ming pressing a hand against his arm with a
          furious and disbelieving expression. His technique had been
          neutralised! His weapon had also been shattered into pieces by the
          young woman. This was something which he couldn&#8217;t believe.</span

          this possible!?&#8221; His voice shook and his face drained of colour.
          Everyone watched on flabbergasted, seeing that he was gravely injured.
          Half of his body had been blasted open and was covered in blood, while
          the young woman&#8217;s expression remained cold. Drops of blood had
          landed on her pale skin which obviously did not belong to her.</span

          suicidal.&#8221; Gu Xianer&#8217;s voice held no inflexion as she
          struck again. Jiang Ming coughed up blood as his body was blasted once
          again. She looked ready to kill him.</span

          weaker than her!?] Jiang Chen&#8217;s eyes widened, his back cold from
          fear. If Jiang Ming hadn&#8217;t shown up and rescued him, he would
          have been killed by her just now.</span

          Jiang Ming, coughing up blood violently, watched her attack once again
          with disbelief. His expression became shocked and desperate since she
          dared to attack him in front of everyone. [Don’t you know who I am!?]

          she prepared to kill him with her powerful abilities.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Enough.&#8221; Jiang Luoshen, who was standing above the
          golden clouds, looked irritated. She hadn&#8217;t expected Gu Xianer
          to continue her attack after knowing who Jiang Ming was and not caring
          about their Clan&#8217;s reputation whatsoever.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          >*Bang!* As she finished speaking, a golden figure marched from behind
          her while exuding a powerful aura. It was in the Peak Sacred Lord
          Realm. This aura settled on the area thousands of kilometres around Gu
          Xianer, and Chaos Qi began to appear. A palm then reached out from the
          sky in preparation to save Jiang Ming.</span

          pale, shaking to their core. They were ready to prostrate themselves
          towards such a display of power. Even the expressions of the important
          figures among them froze slightly as they became wary. There was
          nearly nobody who could rival a Master from the Godly Illusion Clan in
          the same cultivation realm.

          >&#8220;Hmph. You dare protect someone who the Gu Family wants
          dead?&#8221; Everyone watched on in shock as an Elder with cold
          features walked out from among the members of the Immortal Gu Family.
          As his sleeve moved, the sky seemed to cloud over as the power was
          all-encompassing. Another Peak Sacred Lord Realm power surged out to
          counter the cultivator from the Godly Illusion Clan.</span

          the Immortal Gu Family. It wasn&#8217;t surprising that they could
          care less about them. Her face darkened. While there weren&#8217;t
          many forces that the Godly Illusion Clan was wary of, the Immortal Gu
          Family was definitely one of them.</span

          nor him to nearly die at her hand. Offending her wasn&#8217;t the
          scary part; Gu Changge was far more frightening. Any force who had
          some sort of background knew of her as well as her relationship with
          him. Only those forces who rarely showed up in the outside world, like
          the Godly Illusion Clan, knew little about them.

          contained a large amount of power, passed down for a very long time.
          The Immortal Gu Family, in particular, was clearly mysterious and

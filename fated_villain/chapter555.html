          Immortal Foetus grew brighter and brighter. Eventually, the intensity
          of the light became too powerful, almost like a scorching sun was
          reborn within it. The light expanded, taking on the form of a
          wolf-shaped smoke that burst out of Dark Kun City and exited the
          world.</span

          directly at the Divine Rock without fearing that they would be blinded
          by the light. Even the True Daoists chose to shut their eyes, unable
          to clearly see what was veiled by the bright light.</span

          >An ancient tome gleaming with a radiant sheen was floating among the
          stone chips. The material of the tome was a mystery, yet it excluded
          an ageless aura. This immense fluctuation was manifested by none other
          than the text within it, hinting at its mysterious origins.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Contrary to his expectations, the Heavenly Tome was surprisingly
          light, as though it was a net made of Immortal Gold rather than a
          block. Its edges shimmered with a peerless glow, and every character
          within held a weight comparable to the stars, imbued with profound and
          esoteric wisdom.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Sealing Immortals…” As Gu Changge recognized the two ancient
          characters inscribed on the tome, a peculiar sensation stirred within
          him. However, upon attempting to open the Heavenly Tome, an
          overwhelming force akin to an entire world descended upon him. It
          repelled his fingers, making it impossible for him to flip through its
          pages with ease.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Everyone present was taken aback when they noticed the silver
          Heavenly Tome in Gu Changge’s hands. Many True Daoists felt a surge of
          awe at the sight of it, sensing its extraordinary power. From its
          immortal aura alone, they could tell that the tome had likely lived
          through countless epochs. They even suspected that it could be the
          real Immortal Scripture, containing a wealth of immortal skills and
          divine abilities from the Celestial Realm.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A great commotion erupted as all eyes were fixed on the Heavenly Tome
          in Gu Changge’s hands. Everyone could hardly hide their envy and
          jealousy. Even the young and proud prodigies like the Phoenix Lady and
          the King with Six Crowns, were visibly affected. Their breathing
          quickened and their eyes turned slightly red with envy.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen was consumed with extreme envy and jealousy, to the point
          where he was grinding his teeth. Despite his frustration, he tried his
          best to remain calm. He couldn’t believe that Gu Changge was being
          gifted such a magnificent immortal treasure right before his eyes,
          while he could only watch helplessly.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“This thing is most likely closely related to the missing page from
          the Great Yu Immortal Scripture. I must figure out a way…” Yu Feiya,
          assumed a solemn expression as she fixed her beautiful eyes on the
          Heavenly Tome with unwavering focus. She was certain that attending
          the Divine Rock Conference was the correct decision, and her heart was
          ablaze with desire.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In this moment, there was an undeniable curiosity among the onlookers
          to uncover the secrets within the Heavenly Tome. However, no one dared
          to inquire as it was now in the Gu Changge’s possession. This
          knowledge held immense significance as Gu Changge paid a steep cost
          equal to that of a hundred Immortal Crystals to acquire. Even if they
          were tempted to sneak a peek, they knew that the consequences could be
          dire.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Despite being equally curious like the others, the white-bearded old
          man and his companions acknowledged that the tome rightfully belonged
          to Gu Changge since he had paid for it with Celestial Spirits.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They scanned the area and snorted coldly. “Perish your petty little
          thoughts. How dare you all covet the possession of Young Master
          Changge? Do you all have a death wish?”
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          immense aura that jolted those who were blinded by jealousy.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >As the onlookers regained their senses, they felt a cold sweat on
          their backs because they realized they wouldn’t be able to leave this
          place alive today if they harbored any ill intentions toward this
          immortal treasure.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The ancient beings present would not tolerate anyone coveting it, let
          alone Gu Changge himself, who was not even a saint. Those who dared to
          have any ill intentions toward his possession probably had no idea
          what dire consequences awaited them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Sect Masters and other Elders couldn’t help but sigh inwardly.
          They knew that if they wanted to borrow the Heavenly Tome, they would
          have to at least be able to offer a price that could satisfy Gu
          Changge.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Considering the fact that acquiring this immortal treasure required a
          hundred Immortal Crystals, merely a glimpse of it would likely come
          with a steep cost. Given their status and standing, it was unlikely
          they could afford such a price.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Someone cautiously asked Gu Changge through Inner Voice Transmission
          what it would take for them to have a glimpse of the Heavenly Tome,
          but Gu Changge didn’t seem to mind the question. After examining the
          tome for a while, he accepted it, and paid no attention to neither the
          inner voice transmission nor fiery gazes of those Sect Masters.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was aware that the incident today would not only inevitably cause
          a stir in the Upper Realm, but also cause various Forces to have
          malicious intentions. However, he paid no mind to it. He was confident
          that possessing a Heavenly Tome would not bring trouble his way. At
          the very least, no one in the Upper Realm dared to cross him &#8211;
          yet.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Congratulations on acquiring the Heavenly Tome, Young Master
          Changge. Witnessing such a miraculous moment is like a dream come true
          for us all.” Following this, everyone came forward to offer their
          congratulations, but no one dared to mention anything about having a
          look at the tome.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge’s expression didn’t change much. He decided to only study
          this Heavenly Tome more when he had the time. The word ‘Sealing
          Immortals’ made him feel that there was more to this Heavenly Tome
          than it seemed.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Suddenly, an ill-timed voice rang out. “In the present day, the
          Principles of the Upper Realm are incomplete, making it challenging
          for many in various masters from their different Forces to reach the
          True Immortal Realm. I believe that mysterious tome may hold some
          information on this matter. It’s truly a blessing for the Upper Realm
          that someone as magnanimous and helpful as Young Master Changge has
          received the Heavenly Tome.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“With so many seniors gathered here today, maybe Young Master Changge
          should extend his generosity and allow these venerable individuals to
          take a look at the Heavenly Tome. If they’re able to decipher its
          contents, it would be a tremendous contribution to the entire Upper
          Realm, and all cultivators would be deeply grateful to Young Master
          Changge. If I were the one who possessed the Heavenly Tome, I would
          certainly offer the esteemed seniors the opportunity to read
          it.”</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Jiang Chen came over with a small smile, looking all sincere. He had
          the intention of irritating Gu Changge. Since he had already offended
          him, he wasn’t afraid of further angering him.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The intentions of his words were evidently clear. He was speaking for
          the benefit of all in the world, especially those who aspire for
          immortality. His perspective was righteous and he made sure to include
          various senior individuals such as the Sect Masters, Elders, and even
          a few True Daoists present on the scene. His intention seemed to be
          purely kind and considerate toward them.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          repercussions of his words.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing Jiang Chen&#8217;s words, everyone fell silent. It was
          so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. Everyone turned pale as they
          fixed their eyes on Gu Changge. They all looked uneasy, as if they
          feared Gu Changge would get the wrong idea about them.</span

          >The handful of Elders who had previously formed a close bond with
          Jiang Chen wore expressions of shock and dismay as they hastily
          distanced themselves from him. The Sect Masters, too, regarded him
          with cold stares.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were quite aged that they had no eyelashes left, so they
          naturally understood the intention behind the Divine Source Master’s
          words. He was simply taking the opportunity to irritate Gu Changge.
          But in doing so, he was also dragging all of them into his scheme.
          This was unacceptable, as everyone in the Upper Realm was aware of Gu
          Changge’s immense power.</span

          and glanced at Jiang Chen with interest. He was surprised that Jiang
          Chen would say something like that to him at this moment. [Is he just
          trying to be clever or is he just blinded by jealousy?]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          smart. Who the hell do you think are to be giving Young Master Changge
          a lesson?”</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Upon hearing this, the white-bearded old man who was next to Gu
          Changge looked at Jiang Chen frostily. He was starting to think that
          Jiang Chen was a scum and there might also be something wrong with his
          brain.</span

          powerful blow to Jiang Chen&#8217;s body. The smile on Jiang
          Chen&#8217;s face disappeared instantly as blood mixed with bits of
          his internal organs spurted out of his mouth. If the white-bearded old
          man had not carefully controlled his strength, Jiang Chen would have
          been completely destroyed, both in body and soul.</span

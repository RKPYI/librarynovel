      <h4>
        Chapter 166: Fearing Gu Changge’s Sudden Concern; No Good Intentions!
      </h4>
      <p>
        The appearance of Gu Changge instantly drew the attention of everyone on
        the battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it was the Young Creatures of the Tiangou Clan or their
        followers, they all looked together.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the cliffs surrounded by mist took root an Immortal Flower that
        seemed to be blooming with a noble and sacred aura.
      </p>
      <p>
        A man that looked like a young deity sat with fluttering robes and
        gleaming hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although his face was pale and weak, his gaze seemed to be filled with
        indifference and profound meaning, overlooking all the creatures below.
      </p>
      <p>He excluded a terrifying and frightening aura.</p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge!”</b></p>
      <p><b>“He finally showed up!” </b></p>
      <p>
        The person in the lead was a beautiful woman – the leader of the Tiangou
        Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were a pair of golden wings on her back, sacred and dazzling, and
        when she struck, a large rain of light shot forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was Yu Jing, the one at odds with Hei Yanyu of the Black Heavenly
        Eagle Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was here to take advantage of Gu Changge’s injuries, rushing here to
        kill him.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was very powerful, and her Cultivation Base was already in the
        middle stage of the False God Realm.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom! </b></p>
      <p>
        She looked at Gu Changge on top of the mountain with killing intent and
        an icy glare. After all, she had seen his true face.
      </p>
      <p>
        This young man with a dusty temperament and a transcendent vulgarity was
        the culprit who killed Long Teng.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, on the other hand, has been recovering from his injuries and
        has not even shown his face during this time.
      </p>
      <p>Yu Jing was not as foolish as Hei Yanyu thought.</p>
      <p>
        She had been watching him, patiently waiting as she worked with many
        native cultivators to trouble Gu Changge and find more information
        regarding him.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she later discovered that all of those people had disappeared
        in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, Yu Jing knew that Gu Changge’s injuries were indeed
        authentic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most of these cases, his subordinates used a crystalline pill to
        solve problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pill contained a terrifying Sword Qi, enough to make even existences
        at the Half-Step Sacred Realm pale, as even they would not dare to take
        it head on.
      </p>
      <p>‘Such a powerful pill obviously cannot be used so casually.’</p>
      <p>‘How can ordinary people have it?’</p>
      <p>‘Obviously, Gu Changge gave it to them, so what does this mean?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘It means Gu Changge has reached the point where he can no longer muster
        any more strength.’
      </p>
      <p>‘Otherwise, he would not choose to use such a precious pill.’</p>
      <p>
        ‘After all, these are one-time secret treasures. It has a complicated
        refinement process, and if you use one, you will lose one.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Even she had a headache, for the power of these pills contained Sword Qi
        comparable to an attack by those in the Half-Step Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless they themselves were in the Sacred Realm or used a Sacred-grade
        Artifact, who would be left to contend with such a force?
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, Yu Jing concluded that Gu Changge's body must have a major
        problem. There was even a chance that he had used up most of his
        strength against the Inheritor of the Forbidden Demonic Arts.
      </p>
      <p>Otherwise, this situation wouldn’t be possible.</p>
      <p>
        ‘This time I brought a Sacred-grade Artifact. Although I can’t use its
        full power at my current strength, only a wisp of its true might is
        needed to suppress everything.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘It seems that Gu Changge's injury is indeed very serious. This is a
        good opportunity for me to avenge Lord Long Teng and the people of the
        clan! With this, I’ll become famous, and the reputation of my Tiangou
        Clan will soar.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Many thoughts flashed in Yu Jing's heart as she gazed at Gu Changge on
        the far off hill with killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also scanned the many scenes below with a flash of strange
        colour in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Master!” </b> Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels</p>
      <p><b>“I greet the master!” </b></p>
      <p>
        At that moment, the mountains all resounded with mighty voices and
        divine rainbows fell.
      </p>
      <p>All of them were followers of Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        They had fought fiercely with the Tiangou Clan, filled with brilliant
        lights that had reduced even a large mountain range nearby into ashes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that they had seen Gu Changge, their master, who was in seclusion
        for many days, they couldn’t help but cheer and respectfully send their
        greetings to him as they shouted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In their opinion, the reason Gu Changge showed up even though he was
        injured was… to inspire them all!
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the murderous aura of Gu Changge’s followers skyrocketed,
        their eyes red with bloodlust as the sky shook with the cries of the
        Tiangou Clan’s younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The sword pill given by the master can cut down all the enemies!”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone yelled as he used a crystalline pill, which contained monstrous
        killing intent.
      </p>
      <p><b>Puff!</b></p>
      <p>The pill bloomed in the void.</p>
      <p>
        A terrifying Sword Qi suddenly appeared, thick and strong like a
        mountain, flying continuously like a stream, enveloped by a sharp
        intent, splitting apart Heaven and the Earth.
      </p>
      <p><b>Puff! Puff! Puff! </b></p>
      <p>
        The Tiangou clansmen became frightened and desperate as they collapsed
        under the Sword Qi, their bodies and spirits destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I’m afraid you don’t have any more of these pills.”</b> Yu Jing's
        expression was cold without the slightest hint of surprise.
      </p>
      <p>She was already planning to activate the Sacred-grade Artifact.</p>
      <p><b>Boom! </b></p>
      <p>
        A scorching and radiant aura appeared from her sleeves like a small
        golden sun had been brought back to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its terrifying power pressed down in all directions, causing many
        people's complexions to change drastically. Some were shocked, while
        others felt a deep sense of panic.
      </p>
      <p><b>“The aura of a Saint…”</b></p>
      <p>
        [PR/N: Saint = Name for Sacred Realm Cultivator or Sacred-grade
        Artifact]
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“A Sacred-grade Artifact!”</b> someone exclaimed, their eyes full of
        fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only Sacred Realm cultivators can contend against Sacred-grade
        Artifacts. For cultivators below the Sacred Realm, it’s a crushing
        power, impossible to resist!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>‘</b>In order to deal with me, they even brought Sacred-grade
        Artifacts. The Ancient Immortal Clans must be quite nervous.’ Gu
        Changge's face revealed a sort of inexplicable meaning.
      </p>
      <p>He was not surprised.</p>
      <p>
        Throughout this period of time, the various clans of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent have suffered heavy casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
        The outside world has always had a tacit understanding of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is because the Ancient Immortal Continent wasn’t always here. An
        ancestor of the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace had moved it here using its
        supreme divine power from somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, although the other Daoist Sects do covet the Ancient Immortal
        Continent, they endured it and gave face to the Heavenly Dao Immortal
        Palace.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, because of Gu Changge’s plans, the conflicts between the
        various native clans in the Ancient Immortal Continent and the various
        Daoist Sects in the outside world were increasing day by day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young geniuses of both sides have suffered heavy casualties as
        cultivators of some Daoist Sects were even wiped out.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, the Tiangou Clan’s blatant use of Sacred-grade Artifacts served
        to only further this conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was no longer a trip for the younger generation to gain experience.
        Instead, it had turned into a massacre for the outside cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how deeply rooted the Clans of the Ancient Immortal Continent
        were, they were nothing more than a Secret Realm for many Daoist Sects
        outside.
      </p>
      <p>As of this moment, they had crossed the line.</p>
      <p>
        How can the outside world tolerate this? Won’t they be angry and
        retaliate against the Ancient Immortal Continent?
      </p>
      <p>
        This gave Gu Changge a good reason… to “suppress others with might”.
      </p>
      <p>‘What a wonderful opportunity…’</p>
      <p>
        The reason why so many Daoist Sects were so strict with upholding their
        end of the bargain was to ensure that there would be no excuses.
      </p>
      <p>But now, he has created the perfect excuse!</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“For the outside world, the Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace is a large
          and delicious piece of meat. The Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace only has
          control over the entrance of the Ancient Immortal Continent, unable to
          intervene in the life and death matters that go on within.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As he thought of this, a playful expression appeared on Gu Changge’s
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Young Supremes of the Tiangou Clan were, in his opinion, stupid… but
        they were perfect for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        He’d taken advantage of this moment to jumpstart his operations. With
        his identity, he could easily kill this group of natives.
      </p>
      <p>It was then that Gu Changge’s gaze moved yet again.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er, who was forced to join the battle, was entangled by a few
        young geniuses of the Tiangou Clan with bright runes appearing around
        her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed to be a combination of supreme-grade techniques, powerful
        skills, and terrifying divine powers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed as though the stars of the heavens themselves appeared,
        slaughtering enemies across all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Gu Xian’er was small, she showed an invincible demeanour as her
        terrifying Qi and Vitality exploded, surging ferociously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her opponents all paled, vomiting blood and flying upside down as some
        were even beaten into a mist of blood on the spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I said that you have the wrong person! Gu Changge and I have nothing
          to do at all!”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You want to deal with Gu Changge, so what does it matter to me, Gu
          Xian'er?”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, she was so upset that her jade-like fist shook as a buzz
        created a terrifying and shocking sound in the void.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had just left Gu Changge's palace, but before she could fly away,
        she was stopped by a group of Tiangou Clan creatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without saying a word, they immediately came at her with the intent to
        kill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er was so angry that she wanted to fly back to the palace and
        settle accounts with Gu Changge then and there!
      </p>
      <p>‘“You’ll help anyway,” urgh! He was right!’</p>
      <p>‘Me? Help him?’</p>
      <p>‘Like hell that’ll happen… is what I thought.’</p>
      <p>‘No wonder Gu Changge laughed so annoyingly.’</p>
      <p>
        As Gu Xian'er fought with them, she noticed Gu Changge make an
        appearance on the mountain in the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was alright when she didn’t but… the moment she saw him was the
        moment her day was ruined. She wanted nothing more than to rush over and
        kick his chair!
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘That guy is still watching the battle so leisurely, not even making any
        moves. Does he really not plan on doing anything?’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Gu Changge, you b*****d. Your belly is full of bad water… I visited you
        because I was worried, yet you dare bully me?’
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er discreetly grit her teeth. She was angry, so angry that her
        eyes have yet again seemed like they would turn into a sharp sword to
        skewer Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        She then felt a whoosh of cold air, like something bad was about to
        happen.
      </p>
      <p>And at this moment…</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at her from a distance and said unhurriedly,
        <b
          >“Xian'er, you’ve come from thousands of miles to help your dear
          brother… it must have been hard for you!”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>There was an inexplicable smile at the corner of his mouth.</p>
      <p>
        ‘There is no need to show sympathy for this brat. After all, she did ask
        for a good spanking.’
      </p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, don't talk nonsense!”</b></p>
      <p>
        Upon hearing Gu Changge's words, Gu Xian'er felt ominous, her beautiful
        eyes filled with an icy glare that told of how much she wanted to tear
        up that mouth of his.
      </p>
      <p>‘That idiot is purposefully causing trouble!’</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“These two people are together! It’s obvious, yet you dare lie and
          try to hide it from us!”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“The girl is with Gu Changge. She dares to lie even after having
          killed so many of us.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You have no right to complain about what happens next! Get her!”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge’s words riled up the Tiangou Clan’s Young Geniuses as their
        attacks grew fiercer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Runes flickered and rumbed as terrifying divine abilities were
        unleashed, filling the sky with divine splendour and terrifying
        fluctuations.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er glared at Gu Changge bitterly…</p>
      <p>She added this to the list of things he owed her.</p>
      <p>
        At the moment, thinking was a difficult task, as she was left to focus
        on the battle at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although her Cultivation Base had a breakthrough, it was still far
        behind that of the numerous creatures of the Ancient Immortal Continent,
        the same opponents in front of her.
      </p>
      <p>
        At best, she can force a draw, but it would be difficult to tell who has
        the upper hand the longer the fight goes on.
      </p>
      <p>In terms of quantity, the Tiangou clansmen held a great advantage.</p>
      <p>
        ’Gu Xian'er may only be in the Conferred King Realm, but she is a
        Favoured Daughter of Heaven. Within the same realm, she is invincible,
        and she could easily fight against those in the higher realms. This
        battle should be quite routine for her.’<b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Your brother is no devil after all, for I am merely sharpening you. All
        of this is for your own good.’
      </p>
      <p>Atop the mountain, Gu Changge squinted his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        He then continued to speak, as he took on a worried tone,
        <b
          >“Be careful, Xian’er! With so many people around, you shouldn’t be
          careless. Otherwise, you might get hurt.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>‘Why does Gu Changge suddenly care so much about me…?’</p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er was taken aback by his words.</p>
      <p>
        Along with his strange words, she saw a suspicious look on his face.
      </p>
      <p>There was nothing more frightening than Gu Changge showing concern.</p>
      <p>‘Damn it, just how many plots do you have for me…?’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s face soon changed as her anger boiled. She’d felt it, Gu
        Changge’s deep malice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The words of concern were not meant for her ears, they were meant for
        her enemies, the Young Supremes of the Tiangou Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Seems like Gu Changge cares about that girl; take her down quickly.”
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Yu Jing waved her hand and gave the order with a cold
        glint in her eyes.

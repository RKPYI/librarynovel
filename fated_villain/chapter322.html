          rainbow and left the place. She didn&#8217;t notice Qin Wuya, who had

          >&#8220;That character of hers. Although similar to the past, there is
          still some difference between them.&#8221; Then, Qin Wuya also sighed
          deeply. He walked out of the woods that existed since ancient times,
          looked away, and did not take the initiative to reunite with
          her.</span

          hand, which could help Gu Xianer restore memories of her previous
          life; if he suddenly stepped forward, with an unknown origin, it would
          definitely arouse her suspicion. Meanwhile, forcing her to drink the
          water from the Lake of Reincarnation, was something that he was
          against.</span

          plenty of methods. If he really wanted to suppress her and force her,
          it would probably take some effort on his part, and that might not be
          worth it.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The reason why Qin Wuya came here was to find Sky King Zhi Yang’s
          hiding place. He didn&#8217;t want to get into any other trouble. That
          was why he watched Gu Xianer leave secretly.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >At that time, after seeing the reincarnation of his previous Dao
          Partner in the Vermilion Bird Empire, Wuya was excited and planned to
          go to the Black Tortoise Empire to meet his Junior Brother.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With Sky King Zhi Yang’s status, it shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult
          to find out the identity of that woman. As long as he knew the
          woman&#8217;s identity, it would be much easier for him to reunite
          with her.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was definitely a good idea. Unfortunately, the reality of the
          current situation made Qin Wuya feel stunned and stuck. Qin Wuya
          didn&#8217;t expect that he couldn&#8217;t find Sky King Zhi Yang
          after he arrived at the Vermilion Bird Empire.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >On the contrary, Qin Wuya heard the news that Sky King Zhi Yang and
          the Successor of Demonic Arts had joined hands to kidnap a maiden with
          the Celestial Demonic Physique. In the end, he even killed a group of
          young prodigies in the Land of Eternal Overcast, and almost killed Gu
          Changge.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >He was extremely shocked by this. He had never thought that such a
          thing would happen not long after he left for the Lake of
          Reincarnation. At first, Qin Wuya didn&#8217;t believe that his Junior
          Brother would do such a thing. When they were in the Borderless Sect
          in the past, he was weak and timid. Most of the time, he was bullied
          by the other disciples, and it was Wuya who helped him to find
          justice.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With such a personality, how could his junior Zhi Yang do such a
          thing? Kill other young prodigies? Among them, Prince Shen, the
          Successor of Sky Emperor Mountain, had died miserably.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Qin Wuya was not sure what to think of this. After all, people could
          change after many years have passed. His Junior Brother did hold deep
          hatred for Gu Changge. Thus, it stands to reason he wouldn&#8217;t let
          go of such a chance to kill him, even if he had to cooperate with the
          Successor of Demonic Arts.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Afterward, there was no news about traces of Sky King Zhi Yang
          whereabouts. On the contrary, there were all kinds of rumors
          sprouting.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >All of these made Wuya fall into deep suspicion, unable to justify
          his Junior Brother’s actions.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >But soon, it was fortunate that Sky King Zhi Yang had sent someone to
          contact him. He guessed that Wuya had left the Lake of Reincarnation
          and rushed to the Black Tortoise Empire. That Qin Wuya would come all
          the way to meet up with him and discuss their future course of action.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I hope these rumours have nothing to do with you, Junior
          Brother. It seems that the Successor of Demonic Arts is not that
          simple of a person. To seek the skin of a tiger, you have to be
          prepared to be devoured by it.&#8221; Qin Wuya sighed in his heart and
          with a flash of his figure, he was on his way to the place where he
          and Sky King Zhi Yang had agreed to meet.</span
        >

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They hadn&#8217;t heard of someone like the Successor of Demonic Arts
          during their era. It seemed that the ‘Successor of Demonic Arts’ had
          just recently appeared in the next era after theirs. That these
          Successors’ actions over that period had made all fear him. Even the
          Immortal Sects, who had stood firmly since ancient times, would avoid
          the Successor of Demonic Arts and would never let this monstrosity
          grow.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

          at any time.]</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Soon, among the seemingly quiet and desolate ruins in front of him,
          Qin Wuya sensed strange fluctuations. With his vision, he could easily
          recognize these were some hidden formations. Moreover, those
          formations’ were brilliantly made. Even if a Sacred Emperor Realm
          expert would not notice if he was not attentive enough. Still, it
          could not be hidden from Qin Wuya.</span

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Junior Brother!&#8221; At the entrance of the ruins, Qin Wuya
          took the initiative to shout inside. At the same time, he used his
          divine sense on searching the vicinity behind him to prevent anyone
          from following him.</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Eldest Senior Brother, he&#8217;s finally here,&#8221; After
          hearing Qin Wuya&#8217;s call, a man in a purple robe who was sitting
          cross-legged in the depth of the ruins who was cultivating suddenly
          became excited. Then, he stood up in a hurry and rushed to meet Qin
          Wuya.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Junior Brother, are you alright?&#8221; Qin Wuya asked with
          concern as he breathed a sigh of relief.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. Eldest Senior Brother, I&#8217;m relieved to
          see you here.&#8221;</span

      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Then, Wuya Qin and Sky King Zhi Yang exchanged greetings with each
          other. Sky King Zhi Yang smiled and breathed a sigh of relief. He
          finally let go of his uneasiness. In his eyes, Qin Wuya was his
          greatest pillar of support. No matter what happened, as long as his
          Eldest Senior Brother was there, he could solve it. It would be the
          same this time as well.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Junior Brother, what exactly is going on? I&#8217;ve heard too
          many rumors these days.&#8221; Then, Qin Wuya frowned and went
          straight to the point, questioning him.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Sky King Zhi Yang didn&#8217;t hide anything. He told Qin Wuya
          everything, without hiding anything. Including how he hunted down the
          Successor of Demonic Arts, and then was inexplicably wronged and
          framed, becoming an accomplice of the Successor of Demonic Arts who
          kidnapped Qing Xiaoyi.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The ins and outs of this matter were thoroughly explained, without a
          single letter missing.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;The person who set you up, really hatched up a vicious plan.
          It can be said to be perfect and flawless.&#8221; Even Qin Wuya, who
          was experienced and knowledgeable, could not help but draw a cold
          breath after hearing this. It sent shivers down his spine. He was
          shocked and a little scared. Step by step, layers upon layers, forcing
          its target into a corner. [No wonder Junior Brother is in such
          distress, forced to hide in a place like this.]</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;If not, how would I be like this now?&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang
          smiled bitterly, but there was greater anger and hatred on his
          face.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Do you know who had sett you up?&#8221; Qin Wuya asked in a
          low voice, &#8220;could it be the King with Six Crowns? I heard that
          he was the first one to know that you’ve kidnapped Qing
          Xiaoyi.&#8221;</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Hearing this, Sky King Zhi Yang was also stunned. The person he most
          suspected was actually Gu Changge. However, he was unsure. When he
          used the Foreseeing Eye to look into the future, he wanted to know
          what he would encounter in the future. Although he saw the figure of
          Gu Changge then, it didn&#8217;t mean that it was he who planned all
          this. Moreover, when he was in the Land of Eternal Overcast, Gu
          Changge was seriously injured and almost died at the hands of the
          Successor of Demonic Arts.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To Sky King Zhi Yang, it seemed that the King with Six Crowns was
          extremely suspicious. After all, at that time when everything
          happened, the King with Six Crowns was in the Black Tortoise Empire.
          Furthermore, there was no enmity between the two of them, and there
          was no evidence. So, why did the King with Six Crowns decide that he
          was responsible for kidnapping Qing Xiaoyi?</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400">All these could not be justified.</span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Him aside, the second one that was highly suspicious, was the
          Successor of Demonic Arts! Soon, Sky King Zhi Yang told him about the
          three people he suspected, intending to ask what Qin Wuya thought of
          it.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;I see. Don&#8217;t worry, Junior Brother. I will try my best
          to help you.&#8221; Qin Wuya nodded with a heavy look on his face.
          Before the truth was revealed, he couldn&#8217;t assert who had set up
          Sky King Zhi Yang.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;By the way, Eldest Senior Brother, can you help me with
          something? I know you are strong. So this shouldn&#8217;t be a problem
          for you.&#8221; At this time, Sky King Zhi Yang suddenly thought of
          something and asked, looking forward to his answer.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Please go ahead,&#8221; Qin Wuya nodded.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Because the Saintess of Purple Mansion was taken away and
          placed under house arrest by Gu Changge, Purple Mansion is now
          divided. Many Elders are beginning to favour the Sect Leader of
          abandoning me&#8221; Sky King Zhi Yang explained.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;So&#8230; You want me to take action and save the Saintess,
          right?&#8221; Hearing this, Qin Wuya suddenly realised that this was
          not exactly difficult for him. He just needed to sneak into the palace
          where Gu Changge was located without being noticed. Although Gu
          Changge was powerful, he was nothing to him, who had lived for
          hundreds of years in the Nine Realms.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >In the eyes of outsiders, he had only reached the Enlightened Noble
          Realm, but even Qin Wuya didn&#8217;t know how strong he truly
          was.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >&#8220;Thank you so much Eldest Senior Brother.&#8221; Hearing this,
          Sky King Zhi Yang was overjoyed. He still had his own plans, but he
          didn&#8217;t say anything.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >To tell the truth, he felt extremely possessive towards that stunning
          Saintess. Back then, several Elders of Purple Mansion had promised
          that after he took over Purple Mansion, they would appoint Liu Ziyan
          as his Dao partner. And for this matter, Sky King Zhi Yang had
          personally contacted her, taught her, and left a good impression of
          himself on her. But now, she was being confined by Gu Changge, and
          there were even some awful rumours that were being spread, which made
          him feel uncomfortable and jealous.</span

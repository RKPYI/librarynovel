        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spears of light flashed across space from far away and transformed into a vast galaxy as it landed. Each and every one of them stormed the skies and destroyed everything.</span><span id="more-34828"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A terrifying ebony arm stretched out from within space itself and slammed with endless intimidating might.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three incredibly powerful men in black mutilated the Devil Ivy Supreme Being emotionlessly as they stood at the edge of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was arguably a battle of the century. The terrifying shockwaves from the battle had obliterated all surrounding stars and planets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swathes of ancient stars turned to dust under the shockwaves, and the living disintegrated, having given no chance to flee at all. In fact, it wouldn&#8217;t be an exaggeration to describe all of this as pure chaos, as bewails and despair were everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cough, cough, cough…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bloody rain showered and drowned the skies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Devil Ivy Supreme Being was on the verge of dying at this point, as her body had been broken apart, and her soul` dimmed after her battle with the men in black.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Upper Realm had been too peaceful for too long. Even when many Immortal Forces produced numerous True Daoists, none dared do anything without considering many issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lately, apart from besieging the Demoness in Red, who emerged from the Demon-Burying Abyss, and the battle that broke out between Purple Mansion and the Immortal Gu Family, very few world-shaking battles with this many True Daoists had occurred.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To many, True Daoists were invincible existences that overlooked the world like gods. However, on this day, three terrifying True Daoists in black besieged and mutilated the Devil Ivy Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tons of cultivators were dashing towards the scene after sensing the shockwaves coming from that area were shaken.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were even Scared King Realm experts among them. However, they still kept their distance, worried the turbulence would kill them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What in the world happened? Why would three immensely powerful True Daoists attack one person?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Has chaos befell upon the Upper Realm again?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of them asked with quivering voices, fear-stricken and reeling in incredulity, as for all they knew, terrifying chaos would envelop the Upper Realm in the near future, and all Forces would be swept in it. All common cultivators would die in the process if they got caught up in it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone trembled in fear involuntarily, fear-stricken.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah!&#8221; The Devil Ivy Supreme Being couldn&#8217;t help screaming in despair and cast her most powerful Divine Dao ability as her entire body shone with endless Dao, wanting to live. However, her opponents were far too powerful. With three of them joining forces, they could take down any True Daoist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endless light spurted out as Chaos Qi burst out and flooded the entire Star Territory, destroying it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It can&#8217;t end like this… it can’t…&#8221; Indignation and despair enveloped the Devil Ivy Supreme Being&#8217;s eyes when the men in black rushed to her, wanting to extinguish her soul.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crisp sword made of light that seemingly split the world apart shot over from far away just then. It severed all attacks and disappeared into the void like it never appeared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The turn of events shocked everyone, and the many surrounding cultivators, even those from the surviving ancient stars, couldn&#8217;t help widening their eyes with great awe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s…&#8221; someone spoke with a quivering voice while his eyes widened with disbelief.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s Young Master Changge! It&#8217;s actually him! He has come to save us!&#8221; Another cultivator cheered when he made out the appearing figure. They believed the turbulence from the battle alarmed Gu Changge, allowing him to make a move to come to save everyone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A tall figure in white rushed over from the other end of the Star Territory with a terrifying light surging in the depths of his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You…&#8221;  One of the three men in black looked in Gu Changge&#8217;s direction, and for the first time, a sliver of emotion laced his impassive eyes, and he no longer sounded as plain as before.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge… please save me! I will reward you handsomely!&#8221; Upon seeing the approaching figure, the Devil Ivy Supreme Being, who was already in despair, shouted excitedly after a split second stump.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She no longer believed someone would actually show up to save her, let alone for that person to be Gu Changge. After all, this man was an existence who could rival a World’s Will! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[With his aid, I will certainly be saved!] At that, hope reignited within the despondent being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like I wasn’t too late,&#8221; said Gu Changge with a grim frown while gazing at the disaster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He immediately charged towards the battle, wielding his Dao Sword with a frosty gaze. &#8220;Stop at once! How dare you massacre like this!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Slash, slash, slash…*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, terrifying sword made of light came slashing down one after another, causing many surrounding meteorites to crumble into ashes and all Principles to shatter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brilliant, crystal-clear Dao Sword in his hand shone like a pool of autumn water, incomparably clear yet exceptionally sharp.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dazzling lightning seemingly pierced through the sky with each slash of Sword Qi. The three men in black turned slightly grave as they fought back, displaying various powerful techniques, not daring to underestimate him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you think you can stop us alone!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A massive black mist levitated around them like major ancient worlds being pushed forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Devil Ivy Supreme Being cast a Secret Technique, and her Life Force seemingly burned ablaze as she fled into the distance while swallowing a great deal of heavenly herbs, not wanting to get caught up in the terrifying battle anymore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had already reached the point of exhaustion and was powerless to help Gu Changge any further.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Be careful, Young Master Changge. All three of them are True Daoists and cannot be underestimated,&#8221; she couldn&#8217;t help but shout. Although she was confident in Gu Changge&#8217;s abilities, it suddenly hit her that his Source was still gravely damaged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your Source is injured, yet you still present yourself to death. Very well, we shall kill you here and now and help Master eliminate a major threat,&#8221; monotoned one of the men in black as he bore ruthlessly into Gu Changge, who was charging towards him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste your breath with him. Finish him off quickly while he&#8217;s injured.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can&#8217;t let him continue to grow, or he will only destroy Master&#8217;s plans in the future!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other two figures in black showed no mercy either, and as they spoke, a terrifying phenomenon emerged. Tombstones appeared one after another, standing between the heavens and the earth, striking Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endless radiance erupted once again as Chaos Qi, wrapped with various World Principles, fell, covering everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various extremely powerful Principles evolved. Peerless divine weapons interweaved while supreme immortal mountains levitated, causing countless stars to disintegrate one after another from the shockwaves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who are you three True Daoists, and where do you come from?&#8221; Gu Changge stepped forward, with countless sword lights interweaving around him, creating a vast ocean of swords that blocked the sky and sun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three True Daoists also displayed their powerful skills, countering Gu Changge&#8217;s attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge howled, endless light burst out from his body and transformed into an extremely powerful divine sword that killed everything in its path, like a dazzling lightning that pierced through the black starry sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the surrounding watched the scene with absolute excitement. At the same time, they were worried. After all, many knew Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t in his best shape, especially since rumours of his injury had spread everywhere.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of him were three freaking True Daoists! [Can he stop this disaster and save the many surrounding ancient stars?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do you think you still have what it takes to defeat us when you&#8217;re greatly weakened?&#8221; Sneered one of the men in black as a dark divine glow erupted around his body. He was like a fiercely burning demonic furnace, emitting vast amounts of Life Force and majestic divine power.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ll know once you come at me,&#8221; dared Gu Changge with the animosity that swept across the sky and shook the entire domain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unimaginable battle erupted, with endless light spewing out, bright and dazzling, seemingly piercing through the universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Gu Changge cast a Forbidden technique, his entire body shone brightly. His hair was like a river of stars adorned with Chaos Qi, as if he had transformed into an eternal holy furnace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He swallowed mountains and rivers as his black hair flew in the wind, leaving endless tracks of Dao behind, all extraordinary and mysterious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, every move he made followed the will of heaven, in perfect harmony with the Great Dao. With a clear whistle, meteorites turned into powder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a shake of his arm, starry sky collapsed, and Chaos Qi flowed back into the heavens. A bright light swept across the universe, causing everything to tremble and the stars to lose their radiance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three men in black coughed up blood as they flew backwards, seemingly about to be expelled from this world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So this is Young Master Changge!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What terrifying strength. I&#8217;ve never seen him in battle before. Who&#8217;d have thought he&#8217;s actually so powerful?! As expected of the being who could fight against a World’s Will…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And this is while he&#8217;s heavily injured. Imagine how terrifying he would be if he was in his best shape?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many in the surrounding domains trembled excitedly as they watched the scene unfold before their eyes, feeling their minds swaying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How terrifying! No one at his cultivation level can defeat him!&#8221; Even the Devil Ivy Supreme Being couldn&#8217;t help but widen her eyes, feeling her Dao Heart swaying as she reeled in incredulity and unadulterated fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this moment, Gu Changge was unmatched in strength, destroying everything in his way, nearly obliterating the whole Star Territory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not good, this guy is too strong&#8230;&#8221; Howled the three figures as they turned grim. After several rounds of attacks, they had fallen into a disadvantage, and even with their combined strength, they were no match for Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Slash!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, at this time, Gu Changge cast a secret technique, drawing upon the starlight to battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, the galaxy fell, making everything around him a sea of white.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towards the end, one could see that the sun, moon, and ancient stars revolved around him, countless ancient stars appearing on all sides, surrounding him in the centre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This suddenly became a sole-standing Star Territory With Gu Changge as its core standing in the middle, gathering all kinds of light and eventually submerging it all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are no match for him, run!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Run as far as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three figures turned gravely grim and frightened. Without hesitation, they burned their Souls and Blood Essence, turning into divine lights and fleeing. But the aftermath here was still too terrifying. It was as if a universe was headed towards annihilation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heavens collapsed, the earth sank, and chaos descended upon the world instantly. Chaos Qi burst and enveloped all areas, causing zero visibility.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the end of the world!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is absolutely terrifying. Anyone who joins a battle between True Daoists will be obliterated into dust!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those nearby were greatly dismayed as their souls trembled with great fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank goodness, we&#8217;re saved!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there were more who cheered, feeling as if they had survived a disaster. Judging from the turn of events, Gu Changge had defeated the three True Daoists, and what remained of the surviving ancient stars were now safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were utterly grateful for Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, divine rainbows flew up from various places. They were all the top experts of each star, who had been watching from a distance and dared not approach. They only rushed forward now, while avoiding the residual battle remnants that had not yet dissipated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Young Master Changge, for your help!&#8221; They thanked Gu Changge one after another, expressing their gratitude.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Young Master Changge! All of us would&#8217;ve likely died a tragic death, and the surrounding domains would have been destroyed if you hadn&#8217;t shown up&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eyes of many female cultivators were twinkling, even more so, as they gazed upon the tall figure in the sky, unable to calm down for a long time. Even the Devil Ivy Supreme Being couldn&#8217;t calm down, and her Dao Heart was greatly moved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t shown up, she would&#8217;ve likely died just now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge seemed to have just come to his senses after hearing their words and withdrew his gaze from the direction the three men in black fled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re all too kind. I&#8217;ve merely done what everyone my age would&#8217;ve,&#8221; he said plainly while waving his hand, a complete one-eighty from the domineering man moments ago.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge frowned the next second, and his body began swaying immediately. With a muffled groan, blood that was seemingly laced with divinity oozed from the corner of his mouth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, are you okay?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone instantly freaked out worriedly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only then that many remembered Gu Changge fought the three men in black while gravely injured. They felt even more grateful for his rescue after this. In fact, they wanted to bow down to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. The battle just aggravated my injuries.&#8221; Gu Changge waved his hand plainly, reassuring the crowd. However, irreconcilable regret filled his tone as he continued, &#8220;The three of them wouldn&#8217;t be able to escape so easily if I didn&#8217;t have this injury.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Changge, I have—&#8221; The Devil Ivy Supreme Being pulled out a jade box with worry, wanting to hand it to Gu Changge. However, the man didn&#8217;t take it. In fact, he shook his head and said, &#8220;Common medicine won&#8217;t do much for me. You&#8217;re pretty beaten up yourself. Keep it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Devil Ivy Supreme Being was deeply moved by Gu Changge&#8217;s consideration even now. Though this was her first interaction with Gu Changge, she could tell from his actions today that he truly deserved his reputation as a warm and refined person.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that, a thought hit Gu Changge, and he mumbled with bafflement, &#8220;The question is, who are those men in black? The Force behind them must be unimaginably powerful, or they wouldn&#8217;t have dared act so audaciously…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Devil Ivy Supreme Being jolted slightly in response as she recalled a moment during the battle. At that, she mentioned gravely, &#8220;The men in black said something back when they thought I was doomed for good. They seemed to be from a place called Dark Heaven and were following the orders of a certain Master who wants us dead.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it shocked her greatly, it left a deep impression on her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Dark Heaven?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is that? I&#8217;ve never heard of it before.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After hearing the supreme being&#8217;s words, the crowd burst into a tumult, and they had a feeling this mysterious Dark Heaven would soon stir up the whole Upper Realm.</span></p>

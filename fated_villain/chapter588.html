        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, Gu Changge found out from Jiang Chuchu that Mortal Palace had encountered trouble recently, which was as he had predicted. The issues caused by the Eternal Overcast was one thing, while the other was the Glorious Heaven&#8217;s Great Yu Celestial Dynasty discovering an unexplored ancient world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This latter had yet to be proven, but in Jiang Chuchu&#8217;s opinion, it was most likely true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu had no countermeasures against the Eternal Overcast. However, with Gu Changge here, she need not be too concerned about it anymore. He had just sent Ah Da with a Grand Flask, which was formed from runes. For these sourges caused by the Eternal Overcast, they did not necessarily contain an Eternal Overcast Source. Therefore, Ah Da could easily collect them with the Grand Flask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the matter with the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty had attracted most of Gu Changge&#8217;s attention. If he had not remembered it wrongly, back at Dark Kun City, the Eldest Princess of the dynasty, Yu Feiya, had once looked for him. However, he was busy with his schemes and didn&#8217;t have the time to meet her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty&#8217;s group left and didn&#8217;t go to the Kun Mountain like the other Forces to rescue the Ji Family&#8217;s Prime Ancestor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just based on the time when they cut the Divine Rocks, Yu Feiya gave Gu Changge the impression that she wasn&#8217;t simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, it was the massive amount of Fortuity on her. Her cultivation strength seemed to be covered by a layer of mist, and she was clearly far superior to the Sky Demon Sovereign and the Young Holy King.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge didn&#8217;t plan to investigate this just yet. The Golden Fortuity Cauldron that he had placed in Mortal Palace had accumulated quite an amount of Power of Faith. It was enough for him to produce another Dharma Body of Faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The previous Dharma Body of Faith was manifested in front of the Boundary Marker Sea, but it quickly exhausted the Power of Faith he had accumulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Gu Changge had become a True Daoist, if he was to create another Dharma Body of Faith, it should have the strength of a True Daoist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Upper Realm was massive, and as long as someone was sincerely praying to him, he would easily be able to create a Dharma Body of Faith and harvest a huge amount of Fortuity and Power of Faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since ancient times, many ancient beings had the habit of constructing temples. It was clear that their objective was to collect the Power of Faith from all places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Power of Faith was extremely mysterious. There was a saying that even after a cultivator died and had their soul scattered, as long as someone remembered the cultivator and chanted their names, they would be able to reform their body and soul in the endless darkness and return to the living world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there was a prerequisite of a firm faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tuo Ba Xiao Yao, hand over the Sword of World Domination and we shall spare you life. You are already at the end of your life. If you know well enough, you should just hand over the Sword of World Domination. You are not worthy of such an Immortal Artifact. It is just a waste in your hands. If you don&#8217;t want to implicate your family members after your death, then it’s better for you to just hand it over. Young Master Changge might just magnanimous enough to spare you and leave your corpse fully intact.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Exactly. An Immortal Artifact like the Sword of World Domination is only suitable for Young Master Changge. You are nothing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Absolute Soul Cliff&#8230; With bone-stinging cold wind, overflowing miasma, which produced loud ghastly sounds, there was a young man wearing shabby clothes covered in blood. He had escaped all the way here. Even in this kind of perilous situation, his eyes were still cold and he still had a smirk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was standing straight like a spear, and it felt as though he could pierce through heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enemies pursued from all directions like black clouds that covered the sky. Each of them had monstrous cultivation that allowed them to stand at the peak. They had terrifying auras, indifferent eyes, cold words, and were simply emotionless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I must feel proud to have so many experts chasing after me, even using my family to threaten me. As dogs of Gu Changge, you people are really working hard.&#8221; The young man sneered and laughed towards the sky, as though it was of great disdain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Sword of World Domination is in my hands, if you want it, come take it. I shall see who dares to die in front of me.” Even when facing this situation, of absolute death, the young man appeared to be indifferent to it. As though he was invincible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When speaking, there was a sword that appeared in his hand. It was glowing, and it looked as though it was forged with Immortal Gold. The glow was so dazzling that it produced visions of ascension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just the shiver of the blade felt as though a matchless Sword Immortal was awakening. As though the mountains and rivers were going to be engulfed, as the whole world trembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t know the meaning of death and are still resisting obstinately. Young Master Changge is kind-hearted enough to spare your life because of Princess Feiya. But, since you court death, then don&#8217;t blame us.&#8221; A black-clothed elder sneered as he spoke. He was looking at the young man as though he was looking at a dead person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the elder finished his statement, everyone rushed over and was about to kill the young man. But there was a terrifying and unimaginable battle scene that burst out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looked like that same matchless Sword Immortal, slashed out thousands of swords made of light. They covered the sky as they spread out and even caused the world to lose its color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yu Feiya that wretch. I treated her with sincerity and viewed her as my true love, but she leaked out information of me having the Sword of World Domination. It then attracted Gu Changge… She is the cause of my pathetic state! If I have another life, I will not spare her!&#8221; When the black-clothed elder mentioned &#8216;Princess Feiya&#8217;, the young man&#8217;s eyes instantly turned red as he let out a rageful roar from the depths of his throat like a sinister wild beast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as one was human, they would be able to feel the young man&#8217;s despair, rage, and also his hate and unwillingness to accept the betrayal of his true love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the enemies that surrounded him acted as though they didn&#8217;t hear it and were still charging towards him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another huge battle burst out. Fresh blood splattered all over, while limbs were severed, causing blood to flow everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sky and ground were covered in murderous intent, even if the young man was 100 times stronger, he would still not be able to escape!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a scenario of death that didn&#8217;t have any path of survival or life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!!* Right at this moment, the world suddenly trembled. A sea-like terrifying aura descended and suppressed everyone. All of them were suffocating and their skins felt like cracking, they were so weak that they fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young man, who was about to face-off with all the enemies, suddenly shivered. He turned his head up and stared at the sky with vicious eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a slender figure wearing mystical clothes. That individual had indifferent eyes and was emitting a mysterious and distinguished aura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind that individual was an elegant absolute beauty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge! Yu Feiya!&#8221; Seeing the two descending, the young man&#8217;s eyes revealed a bone-etching hatred that couldn&#8217;t be concealed as he yelled out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Greetings Young Master Changge! Greetings Princess Feiya!&#8221; Everyone stopped what they were doing and bowed to the duo with respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Gu Changge, I will not let you off even if I become a ghost!&#8221; The young man glared at the man who sent people to pursue him. It was the man in mystical clothes that wanted to seize his Sword of World Domination. He wished he could slice up his enemy into pieces and smash him into smithereens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Become a ghost? That&#8217;s if you have that opportunity. Hand over the Sword of World Domination and I can let you have a complete corpse.” Gu Changge had an indifferent expression and it didn&#8217;t change even after Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s words. His face was like an ice mountain that wouldn&#8217;t melt for thousands of years, not showing any emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t even think about it! I would rather destroy the Sword of World Domination than let you have it!&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao laughed heartily, but it aggravated his injury and he involuntarily coughed fresh blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately after, he looked at the absolute beauty, Yu Feiya and spoke with even more hatred, &#8220;Yu Feiya, I treated you with sincerity and wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to sacrifice anything for you. But you rather follow the rich and powerful and even told Gu Change that I possess the Sword of World Domination! It resulted in the loss of my family and put me in this desperate state! Don&#8217;t you have any guilt in your heart?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xiao Yao, you have to trust me, I have never intended to harm you. I am not what you think of me. I have never told anyone about the fact that you possess the Sword of World Domination. I didn&#8217;t do it, it was my father! He made me&#8230;&#8221; Immediately after Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s words, Yu Feiya made a pained expression and shook her head as she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Tuo Ba Xiao Yao wasn&#8217;t in the mood to listen to her explanation. With a rageful roar, his body started to burn up and the Sword of World Domination was letting out a dazzling radiance. Thousands of divine swords were awakening, letting out clashing sounds as they slashed towards Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was his desperate attack by putting his life on the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A mantis trying to stop a cart. How overconfident.” However, even after burning his Life Force on this attack, Gu Changge&#8217;s expression still didn&#8217;t have any change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single palm was sent down and it covered the sun. It was so terrifying and it felt as though the stars in the universe were shattering. The difference in strength was so huge that it was like a chasm that couldn&#8217;t be crossed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuo Ba Xiao Yao&#8217;s eyes let out a despair as his body was cracking under the energy. He didn&#8217;t even make contact with this palm, but it felt like 100,000 mountains pressing down. It was going to shatter his body and extinguish his body and soul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xiao Yao&#8230; “ Right at this moment, a figure wearing phoenix clothes appeared in front of him and blocked the descending palm for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Pfff!* Blood light burst into the sky and it was so blindingly red while the ground was blasted open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8230; Feiya, you&#8230;&#8221; Tuo Ba Xiao Yao was stunned as he couldn&#8217;t believe what was happening in front of him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the crucial moment, Yu Feiya came over to block the palm for him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His mind blanked out as he was stunned silly. &#8220;How is this possible?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have never harmed you, you have to believe me.&#8221; This was the last scene of Yu Feiya with a miserable smile as though she was trying to prove her innocence before death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since you wish to die too, then go with him.&#8221; Gu Changge frowned as he didn&#8217;t expect Yu Feiya to block the attack for Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. However, his expression remained unchanged as he continued the palm strike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!!* There was a burst of blood mist. The only thing left in the air was a piece of blood-covered skarf that slowly fell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tu Bao Xiao Yao was dumbfounded when he saw the scene and he let out a heart-wrenching scream, &#8220;Feiya&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Pfff!!* However, the reply to his scream was still the descending palm that instantly covered him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world turned into darkness and lost all color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, General Residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hu, hu, hu…* In a room, there was an upright-looking young man with a tall and straight body. He woke up from his dream with shock and had a miserably pale face. He looked as though he had just been rescued from drowning. He was panting loudly, catching his breath while his body was drenched in cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a period of time, he finally gained back his senses. He was gripping his fist so tightly there were cracking sounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ten years, it has been ten years, but I still can&#8217;t forget about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In this life, I will definitely protect you, Feiya! I will not let anyone harm you! Not even Gu Changge!&#8221; He swore to himself in his heart while his eyes had an unconcealable light of hatred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tuo Ba Xiao Yao’s heart, there were two great secrets that he had never told anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each secret was related to his past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He actually wasn&#8217;t from this world, and came from another world. To be correct, he was from an extremely ancient and massive world where the Sword Dao stood at the pinnacle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that world, he was observing his sect&#8217;s Prime Ancestor trying to breakthrough. He accidentally got struck by the Heavenly Tribulation and reincarnated in this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he was 13, he suddenly awakened his past memory in the form of dreams. Just like what he had experienced earlier!</span></p>

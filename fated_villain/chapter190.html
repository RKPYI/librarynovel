      <h4>Chapter 190: I Need a New Identity; Any Objections?</h4>
      <p><b>[Divine Crocodile Clan‚Äôs territory]</b></p>
      <p>
        In the sky, dark clouds rolled in. At first glance, the place was merely
        a collection of mud and swamps, with black miasma rolling in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately after the emergence of a grey bubble, the void started
        cracking, filling the area with a palpitating aura, like a swamp of
        death.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the jungle beyond the swamp, several powerful and tall
        Divine Crocodile clansmen were patrolling the surroundings, whispering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Divine Crocodile clansmen in golden armour, with dark-gold vertical
        pupils, swept through the nearby mountains and forests.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were on the lookout for any and all creatures that may approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only the Divine Crocodile Clan but also the Ancient Serpent Clan
        were on high alert against any kind of movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were especially cautious of any moves made by the Black Heavenly
        Eagle Clan. Some time ago, after obtaining the Ancient Technique from
        the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan, the Divine Crocodile and Ancient Serpent
        clans all started to cultivate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Ancient Technique was extremely mysterious and powerful, for even
        those with only an average aptitude can progress their cultivation by
        leaps and bounds with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This discovery put many clansmen of the Divine Crocodile and Ancient
        Serpent in high spirits. They felt excited, for they believed their time
        to rise had come.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they had been suppressed by the Black Heavenly Eagle clan, they
        could guess that it was probably because the Black Heavenly Eagle clan
        had obtained a mysterious treasure ‚Äì now known as the Ancient Technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        At one point, the quasi-supreme ancestors of the two major clans
        appeared, waking from their seclusion, to investigate this Ancient
        Technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they saw the Ancient Technique, they were stunned, overwhelmed by
        the mysteries it contained. They were intoxicated, their Dao Hearts
        trembling, as they themselves were unable to comprehend all of its
        secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two clansmen, one from the Divine Crocodile, and the other from the
        Ancient Serpent interrogated a member of the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan
        who revealed this secret with a few drinks. Upon their discovery, they
        were greatly rewarded by their ancestors, their status skyrocketing
        within their individual clans. Many of their fellow clansmen were
        practically green with envy.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have accidentally discovered a major secret of the Black Heavenly
        Eagle clan, such merit was high enough to earn anyone‚Äôs jealousy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, even the patriarchs of the two major clans were in the midst
        of cultivation, completely fascinated and unable to extricate
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, near the mountain range, a crocodile with a very burly
        figure and silver armour, after patrolling the surroundings, couldn‚Äôt
        help but exclaim,
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúThe Ancient Techniquewe got from the Black Heavenly Eagle Clan is
          truly mystical! Last night, I broke through to the middle stage of the
          Heavenly God Realm. And to think I‚Äôve been stuck on this bottleneck
          for so many centuries‚Ä¶‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        When the other clan member next to him heard this, he nodded in
        agreement with the same indescribable feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm close to a breakthrough as well. At this rate, it
          should just be a matter of a few days!! Nobody could have imagined
          that our clan would get such an Ancient Technique. Now that it is in
          our possession, even dominating the whole of the Ancient Immortal
          Continent shouldn‚Äôt be impossible!‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        He spoke with a smile, and a glimmer of excitement showed in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike before, when they were limited by their aptitude and had trouble
        breaking through to a higher realm, they now had the drive to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        For them, this Ancient Technique is definitely a Fate-defying divine
        Technique, giving them chance that could be said as rebirth.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can even allow their clan to grow again and reach new heights of
        glory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúIf we weren't lucky enough to run into that stupid Black Heavenly
          Eagle, I suppose we'd still be in the dark‚Ä¶‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúThe Black Heavenly Eagle clan definitely has malicious intent, their
          heart is condemnable, they wanted to get stronger in the shadows, I'm
          afraid it wouldn‚Äôt have been long before several clans would have
          fallen from their poisonous hands; the Black Heavenly Eagle clan's
          appetite has always been huge!‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúFortunately, their plot was exposed beforehand!‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>As the two said this, they couldn‚Äôt help but feel really lucky.</p>
      <p>
        Only clan members who were in the realm of true gods, as well as some
        talented descendants, were eligible to cultivate this Ancient Technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of them were not even qualified to know about this Ancient
        Technique.
      </p>
      <p>This showed how much significance they placed on it.</p>
      <p>
        They didn‚Äôt even think that the Black Heavenly Eagle clan would
        deliberately leak this information.
      </p>
      <p>Why would someone flaunt out their wealth instead of hiding it?</p>
      <p>They are, after all, greedy too.</p>
      <p>
        This level of Ancient Technique, it's impossible for it to be created by
        the Black Heavenly Eagle clan, but they still don't know where the Black
        Heavenly Eagle clan got it from.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the Black Heavenly Eagle clan's strength was growing by the
        minute right in front of their eyes, and although they weren't saying
        anything, they were extremely envious in their hearts.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúWho are you? Why did you intrude into my clan!‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        The two of them were greatly surprised, and there was a look of shock
        and disbelief in the dark golden vertical pupils.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside the mountain range, a young man who seemed to have travelled
        over a thousand miles in a single step was walking unhurriedly towards
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man walks with his hands behind his back, his body draped in
        wisps of divine mist, as if clad in rainbow-coloured immortal clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The space at his feet seemed to have layers of ripples, crossing
        mountains and rivers in a single step.
      </p>
      <p>
        He appeared as if he was taking a stroll in his backyard, his steps
        elegant and tranquil.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hiss!</b></p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs him!‚Äù</b></p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúGu Changge! Why did he come here?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        These two Divine Crocodile clansmen were terrified as they saw the
        approaching individual, and their voices began to tremble. UppTodatùíÜd
        frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
      </p>
      <p>
        During this period of time, he has caused turmoil and unrest for the
        various clans of the Ancient Immortal continent.
      </p>
      <p>How could they not recognize him?</p>
      <p>
        It was not wrong to say that the man all the clans of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent currently hated the most was named Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his own ability, he had plotted against every clan of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent, even leading the Tiangou clan to its demise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Divine Crocodile clan's younger generation were envious of this
        young man but they did not dare to bother with him in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were, of course, no exception. When they saw Gu Changge had arrived
        outside their clan, they felt a shiver run down their spine.
      </p>
      <p>Even their legs were getting weak.</p>
      <p>
        This young man with a calm demeanour could no longer be treated as a
        part of the young generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the fact that no one was following him, it still brought them an
        unparalleled terror and deterrent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two of them were frozen in place, their smiles gone, so much so that
        they forgot to send a message to the clan informing them of this
        situation.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúHow come you don't seem to welcome this Gu?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>Gu Changge said with a slight smile on his face.</p>
      <p>
        Space blurred, shrinking into an inch, and with a step, he appeared in
        front of them in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had been operating in secret for more than half a month, and the time
        to reap the benefits of it had finally come.
      </p>
      <p>The first place he came to was naturally the Divine Crocodile clan.</p>
      <p>
        With the experience of harvesting the Black Heavenly Eagle clan, Gu
        Changge was naturally not worried about any accidents. For him, this
        process was like planting a seed, which then breaks the soil,
        germinates, grows, bears fruit, and matures.
      </p>
      <p>And all he had to do was pick up the ripened fruits.</p>
      <p>
        To ensure that his true identity as Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic arts
        was not exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge considered that he should get a new identity, such as the
        Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ye Ling was dead, and most of his trump cards had fallen into Gu
        Changge‚Äôs hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also included the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation‚Äôs abode, Lake of
        Reincarnation, Root of Reincarnation and several Great Sacred realm
        puppets left for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, there were no issues in pretending to be the Heir of the
        Ancient Deity of Reincation for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation would not recognize him as
        his heir.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, Gu Changge had killed the true heir he had painstakingly
        chosen and then snatched his opportunities, and now claiming to be his
        heir. It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if he was seething in rage, wanting to
        kill him with his own hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ancient Deity of Reincarnation probably has never encountered such a
        shameless person. If he knew all of this, he would undoubtedly be very
        furious.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúGu‚Ä¶ Gu Changge, what are you doing here in my clan?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        When they realised Gu Changge was speaking to them, the two Divine
        Crocodile clansmen jolted up and asked, petrified.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, their bodies were drenched in a cold sweat, their backs
        were soaked, and they were suppressing the impulse to collapse to the
        ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Heavenly God realm being, one has the power to rule over a city and
        govern the lives and deaths of millions of cultivators.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, they were so terrified of a junior that if this information
        became public, it would undoubtedly cause huge waves.

          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        However, even the Sacred grade Artifact couldn't kill Gu Changge,
        implying that he has the ability to kill both of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúOh, you recognized this Gu? Then that makes this matter more
          simple.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúHowever, this question is too naive, change it.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôd be in your favour if you just keep your mouth shut
          and be quiet.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, with a self-effacing face, said nonchalantly, before walking
        ahead by himself,
        <b>‚ÄúYou two, led the way otherwise you‚Äôll lose your life.‚Äù</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        He said lightly, but the two people were terrified and did not dare to
        speak.
      </p>
      <p>Even their souls were shaking, nearly shattering.</p>
      <p>It was simply too terrifying!</p>
      <p>
        This young man was far more than what had been rumoured, and his
        palpitating, suffocating aura can only be felt when you face him.
      </p>
      <p>
        They didn't dare to say anything, their faces pale and trembling as they
        led the way.
      </p>
      <p>Their scalps almost exploded as they walked beside Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúOf course, take me to see your patriarch. The ancestors will be fine
          too. And inform your clansmen that their new master has arrived.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúIf they don‚Äôt want to die, then tell them to come and see me within a
        quarter of an hour.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄúWhoever does not arrive within a quarter-hour will have no need to
        continue living.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge spoke leisurely, with a small smile, while walking towards
        the depths of the Divine Crocodile clan.
      </p>
      <p>As if talking about a trivial matter.</p>
      <p>‚ÄòWhat?!‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        These words stunned the two of them, widening their eyes and shivers
        running down their spines.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòGu Changge, what sort of confidence does he have to say such a thing?‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòIs he delusory? Or does he truly have such methods?‚Äô</p>
      <p>‚ÄòMaster? What does he mean?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        It‚Äôs just that their lives were in the hands of Gu Changge, so they
        didn‚Äôt dare to say anything at all, but they still feel their heads
        buzzing.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòGu Changge is a ruthless individual with tremendous courage and
        meticulous actions.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòIf he wasn‚Äôt certain, would he be alone, forcing his way through the
        Divine Crocodile clan?‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòDoes Gu Changge look like an idiot?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòSince he had dared to come, he would definitely have a foolproof plan.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Thinking about this made the two's faces paler, and the enlightenment
        they had achieved from cultivating Ancient Technique was suddenly
        obscured by a dense fog‚Ä¶
      </p>
      <p>And soon, within the clan land of the Divine Crocodile clan.</p>
      <p>
        Looking at two clansmen leading a young man from outside the clan
        region.
      </p>
      <p>Many clansmen instantly froze.</p>
      <p>
        The entire clan of the Divine Crocodile violently shook, as if a
        meteorite had struck the deep sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        These two clansmen, in particular, trembled as they repeated the words
        Gu Changge had conveyed.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        The whole Divine Crocodile clan, as well as the various Divine
        Mountains, erupted like an exploding volcano!
      </p>
      <p>
        So much so that even the Clan‚Äôs Defense Array was triggered, and
        instantly enveloped the sky, with glorious light and shining runes.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúWhat? How dare someone forcibly breaks into our clan?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúWho is so bold?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúHe is more than bold; he is courting death! What gave him the
          audacity to declare himself as the master of my clan?‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Shocked voices sounded out across the numerous mountain ranges, and
        several of the Divine Crocodile clansmen who were cultivating arrived in
        an instant, appearing shocked and furious.
      </p>
      <p>
        They did not know the identity of the visitor, but they went there as
        soon as they heard the news.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's method of attracting hatred had undoubtedly reached the
        pinnacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Divine Crocodile clan's hatred was sparked in a matter of words.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the clan members' faces turned red, and their eyes were filled with
        fury and killing intent. Words like arrogance and haughtiness were not
        sufficient to describe Gu Changge's attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Divine Crocodile clan was a large clan that was among the best in
        the whole Ancient Immortal Continent, with tremendous power and profound
        heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even True Dragon Clan's emissaries, who want to visit their clan must
        inform them in advance.
      </p>
      <p>Forcibly breaking in and casually giving threats?</p>
      <p>It was no different from being provocative!</p>
      <p>
        No, this was no longer a provocation, but directly trampling over their
        faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, they did not care what the identity of the intruder is.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        Between the heavens and the earth, a divine light rushed to the sky,
        carrying a majestic and terrifying Sacred Realm aura, and divine sense
        surged, like the vast Galaxy Cluster, descending here.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Sacred realm clan elder of the Divine Crocodile Clan arrived here,
        with a golden trail of light under his feet, carrying laws that were
        incomparably exquisite, intertwined in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄúWho is so arrogant to forcibly trespass on my clan's territory?‚Äù</p>
      <p>
        With an enraged expression on his face, the clan elder locked his gaze
        on Gu Changge, and his pupils suddenly contracted, somewhat shaken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's face was obviously not a secret among the clans of the
        Ancient Immortal Continent.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòGu Changge! How could it be him?‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        Many clan members of the Divine Crocodile Clan who recognized Gu Changge
        were baffled and astonished!
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúArrogant?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smirked indifferently and lifted his hand as the void
        collapsed and a terrifyingly large void palm print emerged, smashing
        some of the Divine Crocodile Clan members who made a move towards him
        into a cloud of blood mist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both the body and the Primordial soul were instantly scattered into the
        air.

      <p>
        He chuckled lightly, speaking as if he didn't put the entire Divine
        Crocodile clan in his eyes in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúGu Changge, you‚Ä¶.‚Äù</b> The Divine Crocodile Clan's Sacred Realm clan
        elder's face changed drastically, and a sense of dread emerged in his
        heart at this instant.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        A span of divine rainbows pierced through the sky, coming from the
        various mountain peaks!
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon, many members of the Divine Crocodile Clan arrived from the various
        mountain peaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of them belonged to the younger generation including the heir of
        the Divine Crocodile Clan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, he accompanied Hei Yanyu with the intention of taking
        advantage of Gu Changge's injury and killing him.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turned out that even though Gu Changge had been severely injured, he
        was still so powerful that he could kill the Tiangou clan's Young
        Supreme who was carrying a Sacred grade Atifact.
      </p>
      <p>He was extremely shocked by this incident.</p>
      <p>
        In his heart, Gu Changge was definitely countless times more terrifying
        than Long Teng, making him extremely envious and fearfull to provoke
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòDidn't Gu Changge already leave the Ancient Immortal Continent? How
        come he‚Äôs here right now?‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        The Heir of the Divine Crocodile clan, Zheng Yang thoughts were in a
        mess.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had a burly body, covered with a sturdy scale armour made of black
        gold. He looked very simple, but he was actually a very bold and
        meticulous person.
      </p>
      <p>
        He stared at Gu Changge‚Äôs figure, and his heart was filled with tremors
        as a result of what Gu Changge had said earlier.

        ‚ÄòGu Changge does not seem like a stupid person so it‚Äôs unlikely that he
        broke into the clan without any plans. He is definitely scheming
        something.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>Zheng Yang's heart was filled with dread.</p>
      <p>
        In his opinion, Gu Changge could only break into their clan because he
        had an ancestor behind him, otherwise, he wouldn't dare to do something
        like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas, their clan only had Quasi-supreme Realm Ancestors, and their
        background is by no means comparable to the Tiangou clan.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúGu Changge, for what purpose have you came here?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        At this time, the old Sacred Realm clan elder asked, with a slightly
        dark face, waving his hand a little to prevent the clan members from
        approaching him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He didn't dare to act rashly since he didn't know what Gu Changge was up
        to.
      </p>
      <p>
        H could still remember the misery of the Tiangou Clan that day vividly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my purpose? Didn't I already tell you that?‚Äù</b> Gu Changge
        stood with his hands folded, checking out the territory in front of him,
        ‚Äòhis‚Äô territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, he couldn‚Äôt help but smile faintly,
        <b>‚ÄúI‚Äôm naturally here to retrieve my belongings.‚Äù</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        As he had already done this before when he took over the Black Heavenly
        Eagle clan, he, naturally, could do it this time too.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge needed something that could hide his identity as
        Forbidden Demonic Arts‚Äô Inheritor in future.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the identity of Heir of Ancient Deity of Reincarnation on top of his
        already terrifying background was a perfect option.
      </p>
      <p>As soon as Gu Changge's words fell.</p>
      <p>With a wave of his sleeves, the void trembled.</p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        A black and white interwoven rune, as if made of six portals[1],
        containing the mysterious power of burying all beings, suddenly emerged
        from the void.
      </p>
      <p>[1: Indirect indication to the 6 paths of Samsara.]</p>
      <p>
        Black and white were intertwined, seems to be containing life and death,
        vitality and mortality, depicting Samsara!
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was using the Samsara Talent. As soon as he did, the aura of
        Law of Time permeated the surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many powerful Divine Crocodile clansmen nearby were horrified by this
        scene, and their faces changed drastically.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúThe Samsara Talent‚Ä¶.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        The Sacred Realm clan elder was flabbergasted, his face suddenly
        changed, and stared at Gu Changge with wide eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        With such an obvious display of Samsara Talent, another identity of Gu
        Changge was about to surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were not like the Black Heavenly Eagle clan, which thoroughly
        investigated Ye Ling's affairs. They lack the Black Heavenly Eagle
        clan's meticulous thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Divine Crocodile clansmen were astonished when they saw Gu Changge
        using the Samsara Talent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúHow is it possible for Gu Changge to be the Heir of Ancient Deity of

      <p>After a moment of silence, everyone was shocked and stunned.</p>
      <p>
        However, once they thought about it carefully, Gu Changge‚Äôs talent was
        amazing, his background was tyrannical, his methods were terrifying, and
        his strength was even more terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Him being the Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation, was not
        something they couldn‚Äôt accept.
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand, they thought it was only reasonable.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòIf Gu Changge has such an identity, doesn't that mean our clan would
        have to surrender to him in accordance with the ancestral oath?‚Äô

        Zheng Yang's heart shook; he had not anticipated this situation at all.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòGu Changge's identity would be unknown if he didn't reveal this.‚Äô</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòOur clan was planted with a slave seal by the Ancient Deity of
        Reincarnation, which means that our freedom is not in our own hands.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Zheng Yang couldn't help but feel resentful, as he looked at Gu Changge
        with many complex emotions; unwillingness, grief, and despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòWe do now agree! Why should we all obey the ancestral oath and submit
        to him?‚Äô Many clansmen yelled in their hearts after the response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially since they obtained an Ancient Technique containing the
        mysteries, which benefitted them endlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were even expected to break the shackles and go to the Upper
        Realm.[2]
      </p>
      <p>
        [2: Heavenly Dao Immortal Palace promised to protect them but they never
        let them come in the Upper Realm.]
      </p>
      <p>As a result, they were unwilling to suddenly have a master.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúSo what if you are the Heir of the Ancient Deity of Reincarnation?

        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, the clansmen of the Divine Crocodile clan were extremely
        angry, their eyes turned red, and they roared, unwilling to accept this
        result.
      </p>
      <p>
        They choose to fight and kill Gu Changge rather than surrender. Soon a
        terrifying Qi and Vitality emerged from their bodies, like a bright sun,
        with runes flooding in like seawater.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù</b> The Sacred Realm clan elder‚Äôs face changed and was about

        Gu Changge shook his head regretfully.

      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        His words had just dropped, and there seemed to be an invisible thread
        in the void, which was suddenly pulled.
      </p>
      <p>He didn't even move a bit, not even lifting his eyelids.</p>
      <p>The robe looked brand new, unstained by a trace of dust.</p>
      <p><b>Boom! Boom! Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        In the void, one after another, a mass of blood mist exploded, like
        being smashed down by hundreds of thousands of mountains, and they
        disappeared into the smoke with their body and soul.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúThe slave seal‚Ä¶‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        This scene turned the Sacred Realm clan elder and the rest of the
        clansmen‚Äôs faces pale and filled with despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, not only the group of people who had just made a move
        against him but also the other clansmen felt the feeling that Gu Changge
        only needed a thought to break the thread that represents their lives.
      </p>
      <p>In other words, Gu Changge had complete control over their lives.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòThe slave seal's power is determined by the person who uses it and Gu
        Changge can directly control our lives and deaths. How terrifying is
        he?‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, Zheng Yang was desperate and his heart was trembling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's methods were really exceptional in this regard, reaching a
        level that few people can achieve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, they had no idea that all of this was the mystical effects of
        the Immortal Binding Arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge also plans to continue to fool and control them with the
        ‚Äúslave seal‚Äù. Of course, he was not going to explain it to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The smile on Gu Changge's face was calm despite all the crocodile
        clansmen becoming quiet and still.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúDoes anyone else have objections?‚Äù </b>He demanded.</p>
      <p>
        There was dead silence all around, no one dared to answer, even the
        Sacred Realm clan elder was silent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many powerful men and older generation who came from a distance turned
        pale, as they did not expect to encounter this kind of situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now they could only hope that the strength gap between Gu Changge and
        the ancestor was too large, making it difficult to control the life and
        death of their ancestor with the slave seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúSince there are no objections. I want everyone gathered in the
          Ancestral Hall in quarter of an hour.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Soon, Gu Changge turned around and said casually.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúIf anyone is absent, then there is no need for that person to

        He added with a smile.

      <p>
        Gu Changge intends to use these chess pieces to cut through the whole
        Ancient Immortal Continent with this terrifying and irreversible knife.

      <p>
        When they heard this, the Divine Crocodile clansmen shuddered even more
        severely; a chill ran down their back.

      <p>
        Gu Changge had a cruel heart, and the Divine Crocodile Clan was

          that he wasn&#8217;t a bad person. After all, he had a divine feeling

          didn&#8217;t think the man held any unfavourable thoughts of her.
          After all, from the man&#8217;s demeanour and gaze, from the start, it

          believe it if she were to say that she had learned of their language
          during their few-day-long stay. After all, could even a genius master
          such a complex language in just a few days? The only plausible
          explanation was that Xiao Ruoyin was already fluent in this

          book that no one else could understand. I somehow knew all the

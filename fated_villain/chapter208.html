      <h4>
        Chapter 208: Aura of the Heavenly Emperor‚Äôs Mountain; Temporary Black
        Pot set!
      </h4>
      <p>
        Just as the cultivators of the many orthodox forces were in discussion,
        a huge golden seal rumbled over, suddenly covering the Great Hall in a
        grey mist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The concealing formation broke, revealing the scene in the Great Hall.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge had arrived.</p>
      <p>
        His expression was extremely cold and murderous. The harsh, threatening
        tone of his voice rang throughout the surroundings,
        <b
          >‚ÄúWho dares to commit murder in the territory of my Immortal Gu
          Family? Simply courting death!‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        He frowned and looked at the two people fighting with a murderous look.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúYoung Master Changge! What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        At this time, many nearby cultivators had also rushed here, staring up
        into the sky in shock and bewilderment.
      </p>
      <p>Wang Wushuang of the Wang Family soon arrived as well, asking:</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúHuh? Someone is trying to assassinate Big Sis?!‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        He had made his way over there in a state of soaring, intertwining
        emotions; anger, shock, and a determination to kill.
      </p>
      <p>Amidst the light of his golden eyes, a murderous intent palpitated.</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúI'm not so sure what the situation is either.‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        The expression on Gu Changge's face was not very pleasant, but he
        remained calm nonetheless, exuding a sharp coldness and killing intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        He slightly glanced at the palace dome as he turned back. An
        inexplicable glint flashed in his eyes, but unfortunately, no one around
        managed to notice it.
      </p>
      <p>[Kshn: How can it be noticed? He‚Äôs the MC after all.]</p>
      <p>
        No one thought there was anything wrong with Gu Changge‚Äôs act at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, this kind of thing had happened in the territory of the Gu
        Family and on his mother‚Äôs birthday, at that.
      </p>
      <p>It was normal for him to be outraged.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúWhoever it is, have guts. I‚Äôll personally ensure you don‚Äôt survive
          today.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's expression soon calmed down, however, his words still
        contained a fearsome murderous intent.
      </p>
      <p>Many people couldn‚Äôt help but shudder at the overwhelming pressure.</p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        At the same time, on the other side, chains of Divine Laws intertwined,
        about to fall like meteors from the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        A force that could crush all cultivators to ashes. It was densely packed
        like a net of the heavens, its grand momentum impossible to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mountainous Sacred Dharma Bodies fought against each other, their
        might and aura shaking the earth, as even the massive mountain ranges
        turned into dust when they raised their hands. Everything else felt
        extremely minuscule in comparison, making countless cultivations tremble
        in fear.
      </p>
      <p><b>Whoosh!</b></p>
      <p>
        One after another, a number of divine rainbows appeared along the
        skyline!
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Gu Family powerhouses and Young Supremes rushed towards the scene
        quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        They had never thought that someone would dare to do something like
        this, as it was equivalent to not putting the Ancient Immortal Gu Family
        in their eyes.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúThis person is courting death!‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        Numerous experts of the Gu family showed extremely cold expressions,
        glaring at the figure wrapped in black as if they were looking at a dead
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, many powerful individuals began to take action,
        attempting to kill the black figure. Auras of the Great Sacred Realm
        fluctuated, sweeping over the place, shocking many guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of the Great Sacred Realm was a mainstay no matter what
        Daoist force they were in, and would undoubtedly become high-ranking
        members.
      </p>
      <p>Not every ordinary old monster could reach this realm.</p>
      <p>
        Yet there were so many of these monstrous auras in the Ancient Immortal
        Gu Family, which only showed how amazing their heritage was.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge took a step forward into the palace.</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúThankfully I arrived on time. Are you alright, Miss Zijin?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>
        He looked at Wang Zijin, who was stained with blood, looking weak and
        pale, and asked with seemingly genuine concern on his face.
      </p>
      <p>Wang Zijin was currently sitting cross-legged on the ground.</p>
      <p>
        Strands of Spiritual Qi were flowing towards her body, like a whirlpool,
        healing her injuries at an alarming rate.
      </p>
      <p>
        This scene was very strange. Every cell had a fairy-like colour, bright
        and crystal clear like stars from the sky.
      </p>
      <p>Her special physique.</p>
      <p>
        Over the years, her Immortal Spirit Body had become more and more
        congealed and real, as every cell glimmered with Immortal Aura; sacred
        and bedazzling.
      </p>
      <p>She suddenly heard Gu Changge‚Äôs voice coming to her rescue.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin couldn't help opening her eyes. Although she still looked
        weak, her complexion was now much better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only she herself knew how she had survived this arduous battle by using
        many of her trump cards. Any other ordinary Quasi-Sacred Realm existence
        would‚Äôve been killed from the first strike alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But thanks to her Divine Artifacts and many tricks, she wasn‚Äôt hurt too
        badly.
      </p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúBrother Gu‚Ä¶‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>Looking at Gu Changge, Wang Zijin smiled slightly, a little pale.</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúI'm fine, this sort of injury is nothing-‚Äú</b></p>
      <p>
        However, as she spoke, some blood gushed out from the corner of her
        mouth, and she shook slightly, seemingly about to faint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge‚Äôs eyes flashed slightly at this sight. His quick hands
        immediately left his sides, supporting her before she fell.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a trace of a smile in Wang Zijin's eyes as she fell into his
        arms with a very weak expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúBrother Gu, thank you for coming to my rescue. I‚Äôm afraid if you
          were a step slower, you wouldn't have been able to see me again.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>She whispered fearfully.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin naturally knew that Gu Changge‚Äôs expression of concern was
        fake.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, no matter how well he pretended, it was easy to tell since
        there was no actual warmth in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Wang Zijin's view, there were two main reasons Gu Changge came to
        rescue her so quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first was that such a terrible event happened in the Immortal Gu
        Family. If it was not handled well by them, they would quickly lose
        their face.
      </p>
      <p>
        If she had unfortunately died here, with the Immortal Gu Family unable
        to even notice it, they would surely be held accountable. Moreover, it
        would inevitably lead to a grudge forming between the Ancient Immortal
        Gu and Wang Families.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge, as the sole Young Master, would definitely not be happy with
        such a situation, thus explaining his reaction. Apart from showing
        concern, he must make sure to let everyone know that the Gu Family had
        nothing to do with the assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, Wang Zijin's injury was no longer a problem, but at this time,
        she just couldn‚Äôt help but want to tease Gu Changge like this. Vissit

        ‚ÄòWhat a cold, ruthless guy; without any special means, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll

        She was still very confident about her own appearance. Whether it was in
        her previous life or this life, she was undoubtedly a top-notch beauty.
      </p>
      <p>‚ÄòMaybe Gu Changge will react a little this time.'</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked at Wang Zijin who had fallen into his arms. He seemed
        stunned and somewhat fazed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But soon, his face returned to a calm expression, and he spoke guiltily.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúToday's matter was a result of the Gu Family being negligent. I‚Äôm
          truly sorry, Miss Zijin. This Gu will take responsibility and make up
          for the losses Miss Zijin suffered one by one.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        With his eyesight, it was natural to see that Wang Zijin had recovered
        from his injuries, and her surging vitality could be called abnormal.
      </p>
      <p>But he didn't bother to care about her intentions.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge had always been dismissive of this.</p>
      <p>
        However, in order to maintain the personality he created in front of
        Wang Zijin, he chose to change the subject without exposing her.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he responded to Wang Zijin, it would inevitably make her suspicious,
        which was not beneficial to Gu Changge's future plans.
      </p>
      <p>He was long familiar with these kinds of things anyways.</p>
      <p>
        Whether it was Yue Mingkong or Gu Xian'er, everything they saw was what
        Gu Changge wanted them to see.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing Gu Changge simply changing the subject.</p>
      <p>Wang Zijin did not look too surprised.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòGu Changge is a man with a heart of steel, he is simply not interested
        in me.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòLook at his gentle and polite tone, but in reality, he is indifferent
        to the bones.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>In Wang Zijin‚Äôs view, this act of saving beauty lacked sincerity.</p>
      <p><b>‚ÄúDoes Brother Gu know who wants to assassinate me?‚Äù</b></p>
      <p>Afterwards, Wang Zijin also got serious and asked.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge glanced at her, and said thoughtfully,
        <b>‚ÄúPerhaps‚Ä¶ the Forbidden Demonic Arts‚Äô Inheritor?‚Äù</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúBrother Gu is right. It seems my identity has been revealed to him.
          He sent his subordinates to hide in the dark, intending to take the
          opportunity to kill me. I was fortunate this Great Sacred Realm
          existence underestimated me too much. This is how I was able to stall
          him.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin said with a little smile. she never thought that this matter
        would have something to do with Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, from the mouth of the existence of the Great Sacred Realm, she
        also heard that its next goal was Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, in her opinion, Gu Changge was in the same boat as her; a
        target of Forbidden Demonic Arts‚Äô Inheritor.
      </p>
      <p>She didn‚Äôt think anything else regarding that.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúThis is because of Miss Zijin‚Äôs strong Cultivation Base. Most people
          wouldn‚Äôt be able to delay them for so long.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge replied, taking a deep look at Wang Zijin.</p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin knew about Gu Changge‚Äôs mysterious Cultivation Base. Let
        alone her cultivation, she couldn‚Äôt even hide her identity, as he had
        already guessed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of Gu Changge, she was the one who wasn‚Äôt able to see through
        the other.
      </p>
      <p>He seemed even more mysterious than her at this point.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúThe Demonic Arts‚Äô Inheritor is rampant to the extreme. How dare he
          send someone to sneak into my Gu Family? And compared with Ye Ling
          last time, the one attacking this time has reached the Great Sacred
          Realm...‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúIt seems my guess at that time wasn‚Äôt off. There should be an
          organisation behind the Forbidden Demonic Arts‚Äô Inheritor.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge sighed slightly when he heard the words, and looked a little
        bit troubled about the matter.
      </p>
      <p>Wang Zijin nodded.</p>
      <p>
        She also heard Gu Changge say this sentence, and now it seems to be
        confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>At this time, Wang Zijin spoke again.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúI suspect that Ye Ling, who Brother Gu fought before, is actually
          not the real Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts. He is just a chess
          piece. With his ability, it is obviously impossible to order around a
          Great Sacred Realm existence.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        And the reason why she thought so was entirely because of the existence
        of the Great Sacred Realm, the man surrounded by black shadows said the
        word ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù.
      </p>
      <p>What does this mean?</p>
      <p>
        It means that there was a greater, more terrifying character behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        That little Ye Ling, even if he did receive the Demonic Arts
        Inheritance, wouldn‚Äôt have been able to acquire a subordinate like this
        instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúOh, how could this be? Ye Ling was just a pawn from the
          beginning?‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked a bit surprised upon hearing this, before frowning:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúYe Ling hasn't reappeared for a long time, so it is difficult to
          confirm whether or not he is alive or dead.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Hearing this, Wang Zijin nodded and said, with a deep chill in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúIt doesn't matter whether Ye Ling is alive or dead. What's important
          now is to find out the true identity of the Inheritor of Forbidden
          Demonic Arts, and what the hidden organisation behind them really
          is.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Although she was decidedly on the opposite side of the Demonic Arts
        Inheritor because of her identity, almost being assassinated by a
        powerhouse in this way still made her feel very upset.
      </p>
      <p>
        It gave birth to an unspeakable murderous intent. She wanted to find the
        real behind-the-scenes person and fight them with all her might.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conversation between the two was overheard by the cultivators who
        came here one after another, and their expressions couldn‚Äôt help but
        change slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        And from this conversation, many Young Supremes had guessed the identity
        of Wang Zijin, their complexion changed suddenly, and they no longer
        dared to be as casual with her as before.
      </p>
      <p>Compared to their Awe of Gu Changge...</p>
      <p>
        The identity of Wang Zijin made them feel a kind of admiration and
        reverence for the Human Ancestor. It was very different.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you talk in detail, the difference was like the difference between
        admiring one‚Äôs past ancestors versus fearing the currently powerful in
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúIt's no wonder that Wang Zijin was targeted. It turns out that her
          identity is actually as the descendant of the Human Ancestral
          Hall.‚Äù</b
        >
        Ye Langtian could not help but sigh deeply. He didn't expect this at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúEven the descendant of the Human Ancestral Hall has appeared. I am
          afraid that this marks the start of our golden age...‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the Young Supremes, regardless of men and women, had complex
        emotions swirling within their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúIt seems that the person who tried to assassinate her should have
          something to do with the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts. Now that
          a being of the Great Sacred Realm has appeared, the world will no
          doubt become more restless!‚Äù</b

        ‚ÄòI don't know if the Human Ancestor will return. If the Ancestor is
        alive, then there might still be hope for this world.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Many older cultivators and strong men thought this in their hearts.
        Since, after all, they also hoped that this world of cultivation could
        be peaceful.
      </p>
      <p>And the person who can return them to a stable and peaceful life‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>Was only the Human Ancestor.</p>
      <p>For the human race, the Human Ancestor was an extraordinary figure.</p>
      <p>
        Human Ancestor, Ancient Emperor, Earthly Kings, and Heavenly Emperors.
        In ancient times, there were far too many ancient existences with these
        titles. No one truly knew the extent of their Cultivation Base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because these titles were given not based on their Cultivation Base, but
        based on their great deeds towards sentient races, which had a different
        meaning for different races.

      </div>
      <p>
        Even the Human Ancestor was split into different branches, such as
        Xuanyuan Human Ancestor, Jiang Human Ancestor, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though, by now, these branches have all disappeared. Only the two-word
        term Human Ancestor has been passed down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Emperor of the Primordial Ten Thousand Races was also actually
        called so by the Primordial Ten Thousand Races respectfully. Because
        across the ages, there were very few existences that could be called
        Ancient Emperors.
      </p>
      <p>Such as Emperor Ying, Emperor Bai, and Emperor Sheng‚Ä¶</p>
      <p>
        But they were all amazing talents without exception. No one could ever
        tell their Cultivation Base, as even if a True Immortal, or some
        existence stronger than a True Immortal, stood in front of them‚Ä¶ they
        would not be guaranteed to win against the Ancient Emperors.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the great achievements, people worship and chant day and night, so
        that even after death, the body would be surrounded by endless
        ceremonial mantras. It was potent enough to drag one back from Hell
        itself!
      </p>
      <p>From this, we can see its horror.</p>
      <p>
        Throughout infinite eras, there were very few existences that can be
        recognized by sentient beings as worthy of being called Ancient
        Emperors.
      </p>
      <p><b>Boom!</b></p>
      <p>
        That is to say, when everyone was talking about it and was extremely
        shocked by this tonight, in the high altitude, that amazing battle was
        finally over.
      </p>
      <p>Terrible waves swept across the sky and the ground.</p>
      <p>
        The moment powerhouses from Gu Family took action, there was no suspense
        in this battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the siege of many Great Sacred Realm powerhouses, the figure
        surrounded by rich black runes uttered an earth-shattering shout, as if
        he knew that there was no possibility of surviving.
      </p>
      <p><b>Puff!</b></p>
      <p>
        The next moment, he was like a small black sun, suddenly swelling and
        becoming bigger, and the black rune, circulating in it, burst out with
        light that made everyone's heart palpitate!
      </p>
      <p>At the critical moment, he chose to blow himself up!</p>
      <p>
        How terrifying was the self-destruction of a Great Sacred Realm? No one
        needed to say it out loud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, everyone's colour changed, their spirits were trembling, and even
        their legs were weak and they slumped directly to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>‚ÄúHe can't escape.‚Äù</b> Wang Zijin whispered, but she seemed very
        calm.
      </p>
      <p><b>Buzz!</b></p>
      <p>
        At this time, on the inner island of Gu's family, a light cough sounded,
        as if he was embarrassed because it was a little late.
      </p>
      <p>And suddenly!</p>
      <p>
        A huge palm appeared, covering the heaven and the earth, and one of them
        seemed to be annihilating the universe, and another was recreating it!
      </p>
      <p>
        The runes were flowing, and the glow of the sun flickered, like chaos
        hovering up and down in the void, just as if the Galaxy Cluster hangs
        one after another and condenses there.
      </p>
      <p>The momentum was overwhelming and shocked the world.</p>
      <p>The self-detonating wave of aura instantly calmed down.</p>
      <p>
        After a moment of silence, the sound of inhaling cold air sounded below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúI'm afraid that the fluctuation of the attack just now has far
          surpassed what a Quasi-Supreme Realm could achieve. Was it a Supreme
          Realm‚Äôs Attack?!‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p><b>Hiss!</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúThe Gu Family‚Äôs foundation is too terrifying. They already possess
          numerous cultivators in the Sacred Realm, yet now there is also a
          Supreme coming out to obliterate everything.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Quasi-Supreme was already an ancestor-level existence of various Daoist
        forces. A Supreme Realm existence was definitely a walking myth.
      </p>
      <p>
        For so many of the cultivators present, it was their first time seeing a
        Supreme existence‚Äôs attack. This palm seemed to cover the whole
        universe. It was so tyrannical that it made their scalps numb and
        tremble to the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúIt's a pity that it chose to blow itself up, leaving no useful
          information.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this scene, Gu Changge shook his head regretfully,
        <b
          >‚ÄúThe time for the ancestor to take action was too slow, but if a
          Great Sacred Realm existence wants to blow himself up, it will be
          difficult to stop it either way.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Zijin shook her head when she heard the words,<b>
          ‚ÄúEven if he is suppressed, I am afraid that he won't get any useful
          news. If they dare to assassinate me, and in broad daylight no less,
          then they must have concocted a solid strategy with no loopholes. It‚Äôd
          be impossible not to think of such a possibility.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge smiled,
        <b>‚ÄúMiss Zijin‚Äôs words are reasonable, I have worried too much.‚Äù</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked in the direction where the aftermath had dissipated, and his
        eyes flashed with a different colour.
      </p>
      <p>This self-detonation was naturally what he himself had ordered.</p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge still kept one of its hands. After all, this kind of
        puppet has strong regenerating power. So as long as it is not really
        fully wiped out, there was still a chance to recover.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, he only needed to send people to guard the palace, so that
        the cultivators of all major forces can perceive and detect its breath,
        and he can achieve his purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then he could recover the core of the puppet from the broken runes.
      </p>
      <p>After being repaired, it can be reused in the future.</p>
      <p>
        And soon, as Gu Changge expected, many strong men rose into the sky and
        rushed to the sky to verify the identity of the figure from the
        lingering aura.
      </p>
      <p>Many people now know the identity of Wang Zijin.</p>
      <p>The position of the Ancestral Hall was almost otherworldly.</p>
      <p>No one dared to offend them easily.</p>
      <p>
        Who would attack and kill Wang Zijin for no reason? The Immortal Gu
        Family? How could this be possible? If Wang Zijin had an accident in the
        Ancient Immortal Gu Family, they would definitely be the first to take
        the blame.
      </p>
      <p>
        They would be rushing to protect her with all their might instead of
        killing her.
      </p>
      <p>
        So many people thought of the Inheritor of Forbidden Demonic Arts, and
        for a while, a layer of haze appeared on everyone's heads.
      </p>
      <p>The younger generation was robbed before.</p>
      <p>
        But now it was the Great Sacred Realm cultivator, what does this mean?
        It goes without saying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even many old people had a cold back at this time, giving birth to bad
        emotions.
      </p>
      <p>They sensed the threat.</p>
      <p>
        ‚ÄòBehind the Inheritors of Forbidden Demonic Arts, I am afraid that, just
        as Young Master Changge guessed that day, there is an organisation.‚Äô
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people guessed in their hearts, especially the younger generation,
        and now they were in awe of Gu Changge to the extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no difference between his words and an oracle‚Äôs predictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon, Gu Changge also came to the sky, closing his eyes and being
        like the rest of the strong, seeming to perceive the aftermath of the
        battle just now, so as to determine its origin.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, in reality, he was looking for the core of the puppet and intended
        to quietly take it away.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >‚ÄúIf this old man has guessed right, the aura seems to be from the
          secret technique of the Heavenly Emperor's Mountain.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, an old antique with a very long history suddenly
        exclaimed, his closed eyes suddenly opened, and he was extremely
        shocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        His words also caused the rest of the strong nearby to open their eyes,
        revealing shock and disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>For a while, the place even quieted down.</p>
      <p>
        And Gu Changge also found the core of the puppet and quietly placed it
        in the Inner World.
      </p>
      <p>
        He also opened his eyes and sighed slightly,
        <b
          >‚ÄúThis remaining aura of combat is exactly the same as Ye Ling when he
          fought me that day. The two seem to be of the same origin.‚Äù</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, many old antiques have also sensed it. They obviously
        have an understanding of Forbidden Demonic Arts and will not make an
        error in judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the high altitude, more and more cultivators came, and the atmosphere
        became very heavy.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing this, Gu Changge smiled deeply.</p>
      <p>‚ÄòNow, the temporary black pot has been set‚Ä¶‚Äô</p>

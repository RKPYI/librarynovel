        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside Ancient Mulberry City, the Snow Sword Immortal approached in her plain green robe. Her hair was fluttering in the cold wind.</span><span id="more-33868"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just a blink of an eye, she entered the city without being noticed by the soldiers patrolling the city walls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the strongest cultivators in the Profound Sword World, she had already reached the Earth Sword Immortal Realm many years ago. Unless she wanted to be found, it was impossible for ordinary cultivators to discover her whereabouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The aura of this city…&#8221; While walking on the street, she slightly scowled behind her mask, sensing an unusual aura within Ancient Mulberry City, which was apparently not as simple as it seemed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the purpose of her visit was to meet Gu Changge, not to explore the special features of Ancient Mulberry City. Thus, she quickly dismissed the thought.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the Emperor of Southern Light Empire, she learned that Gu Changge accompanied Ah Qing back to her Family, so she was certain that they would come to Ancient Mulberry City. As the matter concerned the life and death of the Profound Sword World, she had to take a huge risk to come here in search of the truth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;City Lord, a woman is outside the manor. She claims to be the Snow Sword Immortal. She is requesting to see you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the City Lord Manor, the old City Lord was reading a letter in his hand with a frown. Upon hearing the report, he visibly grew uncertain and suspicious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Snow Sword Immortal? Why would she come now? Is it because of the Sword Immortal Order?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, he was aware of the Sword Immortal Order, but given that Gu Changge had saved Ah Qing&#8217;s life, he couldn&#8217;t bring himself to turn against him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal was the Sect Master of Sword Cliff, also known as the Cliff Master. Possessing extraordinary, immeasurable strength, she had once froze a cold lake of thousands of kilometres with her sword, and slaughtered a monster of comparable cultivation level as her, intimidating the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her appearance in Ancient Mulberry City at such a moment unavoidably reminded the old City Lord of the Sword Immortal Order.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a matter of fact, Shu Sect and Sword Cliff were of the same origin. The current Snow Sword Immortal used to cultivate in the Shu Sect back then. Now that the Shu Sect used the Sword Immortal Order in an attempt to take down Gu Changge, she had no reason to ignore it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the old City Lord couldn&#8217;t help but wonder whether her sudden visit was to take action against Gu Changge?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This matter must be reported to Young Master Gu. As he has saved Ah Qing&#8217;s life, I must not be ungrateful,&#8221; the old City Lord said with a pondering look. He then asked his steward, Lin En, to notify Gu Changge of the matter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, he got up and walked out of the manor. After all, his guest was an Earth Sword Immortal, someone he wouldn&#8217;t dare to disrespect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Why has Senior Snow come alone? How reckless of her! It would be extremely difficult for her to capture that man on her own.] Indubitably, Lin En overheard the report of the subordinate and subconsciously shook his head.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he was worried about the Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s safety, for his own disguise, he decided to inform Gu Changge about her arrival. After all, he was now merely a steward of the City Lord Manor, so he couldn&#8217;t afford to have his identity exposed at such a moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of seniority, he was the Snow Sword Immortal’s peer, but as the latter was remarkably older than him, he courteously addressed her as &#8216;Senior.&#8217;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal was considered the most genius prodigy in the Profound Sword World in 3,000 years, but she was still inferior when compared to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, as Lin En was being extremely discreet, he didn&#8217;t expose himself to the outside world, so nobody knew about him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, shall I deal with the people watching us outside the city?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the courtyard, Gu Changge was feeling particularly fascinated and relaxed. Smoking hot tea was served on the stone table before him. After gently blowing his tea, he slowly sipped it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Ah Da stood reverently beside him, clad in black armour with gleams around it. He exuded a daunting aura that instilled fear into anyone around him as he respectfully asked Gu Changge that question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No need. Since they want to watch, we&#8217;ll let them watch. Though, the Sword Immortal Order does pique my interest.&#8221; Gu Changge casually let out a snicker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, he had reached a cultivation level where he could virtually cover the entire Profound Sword World with his divine sense, and even the slightest disturbance in Ancient Mulberry City couldn&#8217;t escape his notice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Since that group of people wishes to use the Sword Immortal Order&#8217;s power against me, I shall welcome them. Perhaps, I can even teach them the meaning of despair. Only after they experienced despair could they finally grow wise. By then, they shall obediently seek the whereabouts of the World’s Will as well as the World Source for me.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, a woman who claims to be the Snow Sword Immortal has come to the manor. Do you want to hide somewhere?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, Lin En knocked on the door of the courtyard and voiced a question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Snow Sword Immortal, as in the Most Graceful Damsel of the Southbarren State?&#8221; Gu Changge softly chuckled as strangeness flashed across his eyes. &#8220;Since she is here for me, why should I hide from her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin En was taken aback for a moment, not knowing how to respond, but since he was only here to notify Gu Changge about it, it was up to the latter whether he wished to meet with her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s sudden visit also alarmed both Ah Qing and Princess Xuan Dea, who was her direct disciple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accordingly, everyone was gathered In the main hall of the City Lord Manor. The old City Lord carried an uncertain yet respectful look as he couldn&#8217;t fathom the purpose of the Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s visit. He didn&#8217;t detect any ill will from her, and she claimed that she merely wanted to meet with Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, the old City Lord was confused. [Is the Sword Immortal Order perhaps ineffective against the Snow Sword Immortal?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, the Snow Sword Immortal was standing in the centre of the hall. In her plain, elegant robe, she resembled a goddess of the utmost grace. Her skin was delicate as her flawless, thought-provoking snowy hands were exposed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silently, she stared at Gu Changge without saying a word yet countless thoughts were zooming across her mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master.&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea hurried over and respectfully greeted.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, the Snow Sword Immortal glanced at her and lightly nodded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did you come all the way here to see me?&#8221; Gu Changge, who then entered the grand hall, fascinatedly asked.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal nodded and replied in a cool tone, &#8220;Indeed. I&#8217;ve been told by the Southern Light Emperor about the matter you said. I wish to know if you are trustworthy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her plan was different from that of the Old Sword Immortal, as the consequences of using the Sword Immortal Order was too great. If that were to cause Gu Changge, who bore no ill intent against Profound Sword World, to feel disdainful towards their world, then they would be the greatest criminals to condemn their world to ruin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, thanks to the Otherworldly Sky Demons she had captured, she now had some knowledge about the Upper Realm, hence she understood how terrifying Gu Changge&#8217;s might and influence was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Whether I am trustworthy is not something I can just prove with words, is it?&#8221; Gu Changge casually smiled as he fixed his gaze on her face. &#8220;Speaking of which, you wear a mask to face others. Is that an attitude you should possess?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, the Snow Sword Immortal glowered underneath her mask. Although she was titled the Most Graceful Damsel of Southbarren State, basically no one in the world had ever seen her face. Ever since she reached the Earth Sword Immortal Realm, no one dared to speak such rude words to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Princess Xuan Dea and the rest were also dazed, seeing how Gu Changge&#8217;s attitude toward the Snow Sword Immortal wasn&#8217;t as amicable as he was to them. [Is it because Master came with unclear intentions? Has she come with hostility?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Master, Young Master Gu is different from the rest of the Otherworldly Sky Demons,&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea worriedly stated, fearing that a conflict might arise between her own Master and Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon those words, the Snow Sword Immortal nodded.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she was about to respond, Gu Changge interrupted with a faint grin, &#8220;Do you know about the Sword Immortal Order?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those three words left a frown on the Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s face and even rendered the old City Lord and the rest shivering as a spine-chilling sensation crawled surged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The old City Lord was about to inform Gu Changge of the matter, yet the latter brought it up before he could say it. [How did Young Master Gu know of this?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereupon, Ah Qing revealed a face of bafflement. &#8220;Sword Immortal Order? What is that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a dull voice, Princess Xuan Dea explained, &#8220;The Sword Immortal Order is a secret commandment of the Shu Sect. It grants them the power to gather all Sword Immortals in the world, and it is only used when something huge happens…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She refrained from explaining further, but Ah Qing quickly understood the situation, after which the latter&#8217;s face, too, grew dark. Essentially, the purpose of Shu Sect using the Sword Immortal Order at such a moment needed no explanation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Ah Qing&#8217;s eyes, Gu Changge bore no ill intent against Profound Sword World. Not only did he save her life, but he even sent her back home. If Shu Sect were to choose to take action against Gu Changge now, they would be making Gu Changge an enemy of Profound Sword World, and no one in the world could bear the consequences of that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I did not participate in Shu Sect&#8217;s Sword Immortal Order, but the rest of the Earth Sword Immortals who have received the news must be on their hurried way to Ancient Mulberry City right now,&#8221; the Snow Sword Immortal stated, having no desire to lead Gu Changge into misunderstanding that she was one of his enemies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Do they perhaps intend to kill me?&#8221; Gu Changge lightly chuckled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Snow Sword Immortal shook her head. &#8220;They simply aim to capture you in order to command the Otherworldly Sky Demons to get out of our world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Capture me? Do you think they could do that?&#8221; Gu Changge questioned without a change on his face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Ah Qing, Princess Xuan Dea, and the rest who remained by the side were thoroughly dumbfounded, oblivious to the happening of such a great incident headed their way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shu Sect&#8217;s Sword Immortal Order was capable of gathering all Sword Immortals in the world. Although there weren&#8217;t countless Earth Sword Immortals remaining in Profound Sword World, their number wasn&#8217;t insignificant either.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Ah Qing and the rest had yet to spend much time with Gu Changge, they could tell that his strength could only be described as &#8216;immeasurable,&#8217; and the Earth Sword Immortals were definitely no match for him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You may be incredibly strong, but in this world, it is not determined that you&#8217;ll be able to evoke your full power. What if there&#8217;s an accident?&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal gazed at Gu Changge as she spoke in a cold tone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Gu Changge simply laughed it off without saying more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If this is the purpose of you coming to see me, then you have certainly accomplished it.&#8221; He leisurely waved his hand. &#8220;I have no interest in your world, but if you dare get on my nerves, you&#8217;ll learn to fully understand what regret is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you have a purpose for coming here? Perhaps we can come to a compromise.&#8221; Surprised by how quickly Gu Changge dismissed her, the Snow Sword Immortal spoke with a voice as captivating as a spring breeze, yet it harboured an unwavering determination that resembled the shriek of a phoenix.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, she got to confirm one of her inferences—Gu Changge had no intentions of attacking. Otherwise, since she came alone, it would be easy for Gu Changge to take her down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Compromise? As long as you don&#8217;t get on my nerves, without a grudge, I&#8217;d prefer to stay away from the worldly feuds.&#8221; Gu Changge revealed an uncanny expression before smilingly answering. [It seems the Snow Sword Immortal isn&#8217;t as smart as the rumours claim her to be.]</span></p>

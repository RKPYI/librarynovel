      <h4>
        Chapter 165: An Endless Foundation; Xian’er Don’t Blame Your Brother for
        the Harsh Training!
      </h4>
      <p>Gu Changge was unsurprised by Gu Xian'er's choice.</p>
      <p>
        Between Heaven and Earth, is there anyone who can escape their natural
        desire for wealth?
      </p>
      <p>Even secluded cultivators need money to buy their essentials.</p>
      <p>He had known of Gu Xian’er’s poor status for quite some time now.</p>
      <p>
        As such, Gu Changge had long made all the preparations necessary to
        suppress his ‘dear’ cousin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even information about the Peach Village backing Gu Xian'er was in his
        hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        So obviously, her money grubbing nature was something he understood very
        clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, in order to put on a flawless act, Gu Changge simply spoke a
        few words that were guaranteed to rile her up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s belief of who he is wouldn’t change so easily, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘As for these ten Divine Weapons... let’s treat it as a small
        compensation for Gu Xian'er.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘This Gu isn’t someone so cold and heartless as to not understand her
        kindness towards him.’
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Gu Changge has his own arrangements, so he wouldn’t so
        easily ‘forgive’ Gu Xian’er.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, from Gu Changge’s point of view, his actions today would
        only lead to more and more positive developments. Gu Xian’er’s
        determination to search for and uncover the secrets behind the ‘bone
        digging incident’ of that year was something he needed to further
        cultivate and grow for it to finally bear fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her curiosity must be cultivated to the point that she will be unable to
        help but search for the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge had a few more tricks to help this matter along, but the
        current Gu Xian’er was far from being fully convinced of his lies.
      </p>
      <p>‘Things need to get even more interesting.’</p>
      <p>
        He narrowed his eyes slightly, glancing at Gu Xian’er, who he just told
        to choose between 10 Divine Weapons of her choice before leaving.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian’er no longer felt flustered at his arrogant words.</p>
      <p>
        It was difficult to make Gu Changge bleed out his wealth this heavily.
      </p>
      <p>She would not miss such a good opportunity.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Equal exchange? So be it. My origin healing medicine doesn’t come
          cheap. It took a lot of time and effort to finally get my hands on
          it.”</b
        >
        Gu Xian'er spoke.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was explaining to Gu Changge, but in fact she was just trying to
        comfort herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge spoke not a word in response, merely continuing to
        sit upon his throne, a look of indifference and boredom on his pale
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        The robes on his body began to flutter even without the presence of
        wind.
      </p>
      <p><b>Hum!</b></p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, the Divine Armory boomed with a bright light, as if heralding
        the opening of a peerless treasure house, almost unbearably dazzling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The red bird on Gu Xian'er's shoulder chirped at her upon witnessing the
        bedazzling situation.
      </p>
      <p>It was like he was trying to convey something to Gu Xian'er.</p>
      <p>
        And Gu Xian’er could not help but show a little bit of surprise on her
        face in response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her brows rose high while a look of smugness spread out through her rosy
        features, and she glanced at Gu Changge with an expression that all but
        spelled out—
      </p>
      <p>‘Hehe, I’ll suck you dry.’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge almost rolled his eyes. He already knew the red bird’s race
        alongside its treasure hunting talent.
      </p>
      <p><b>“So you speak bird.”</b> He glanced at the red bird.</p>
      <p>
        Since it was Gu Xian’er’s pet, he had no malicious intentions towards
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, at this moment, the red bird felt his soul shudder in abject
        fear. It was as if something was staring at him… ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on
        𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
      </p>
      <p>Yet this feeling disappeared as soon as Gu Changge looked away.</p>
      <p>
        Hiding under his bristling feathers, the big red bird peeked at Gu
        Changge, his eyes filled with horror, trembling slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unobservant Gu Xian’er did not notice any of this, focusing on Gu
        Changge’s somewhat provocative words instead.
      </p>
      <p>She pouted.</p>
      <p>Why did it feel like he was belittling her?</p>
      <p>
        <b>“You’re the one speaking bird</b>[1]<b>.”</b> Gu Xian'er gave Gu
        Changge a dissatisfied look.
      </p>
      <p>[1. ‘Bird’ can mean ‘nonsense’ in Chinese.]</p>
      <p>
        The aforementioned ‘bird language’ was actually her way of communicating
        with Ah Hong, who had helped her find lots of goodies before this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's face was very pale, but even he couldn't help but show a
        faint smile at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“That big red bird on your shoulder isn’t bad at all, how about you
          lend it to your dear brother for a while?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The abnormality in his expression when facing the red bird had already
        vanished.
      </p>
      <p>
        His words made Gu Xian’er secretly pout in her heart, it seemed as if
        she had truly smacked Gu Changge’s sore spot, yet now...
      </p>
      <p>This speed of face changing was simply unparalleled.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Don't even think about it.”</b> Gu Xian'er directly shattered Gu
        Changge's unrealistic idea.
      </p>
      <p>Ah Hong came out of the Peach Village with her.</p>
      <p>She and the red bird were practically partners in crime.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge wants to rob her of him? What a crazy and indulgent idea!
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Hurry up and pick. You look like a peasant who’s never seen riches
          and the world before. It's just ten weapons, why must you take so
          long?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge raised his eyebrows slightly, acting like an arrogant yet
        wealthy b*****d.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er’s eye twitched. Her anger was barely contained as she swore
        that one day she would use all the Divine Weapons in the world to smash
        Gu Changge’s face in.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, he was currently severely injured, so she would not bother him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, the matter of him bullying her like this would never end so
        easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the guidance of the thieving red bird, Gu Xian’er soon selected
        ten different Divine Weapons from Gu Changge’s treasure trove.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were so many goodies within it that, even if she picked the ten
        most suitable weapons for her, it still held many precious items that
        made her green with envy.
      </p>
      <p>‘If it were not for Gu Changge...’</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er wanted to use her usual money grubbing method and rob her own
        cousin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before this, she had always felt that she was quite the rich little
        woman, having no shortage of Divine Artifacts, Spiritual Pills, Mystical
        Medicines, Ancient Martial Arts, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, in front of Gu Changge, she finally understood what being
        rich truly meant!
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge truly did not disappoint.</p>
      <p>
        Ignoring her eager and reluctant eyes, he closed the Divine Armoury, not
        allowing her to stay for a moment longer to prevent a possible theft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faced with temptation, Gu Xian’er’s money-grubbing personality abruptly
        burst out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge. In fact, I still have another Divine Pill for healing. I
          think one Divine Pill may not be enough for your injury...”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>[PR/N: Greedy tsundere…]</p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er was not at all embarrassed as she said these words.</p>
      <p>
        Her tone and expressions were even quite cold and calm, as if she was
        seriously considering Gu Changge’s health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who did not know her might think she was really hoping for Gu
        Changge’s recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Gu Xian'er, you shouldn’t indulge in your fantasies.”</b> Gu Changge
        interrupted her with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>The old monsters in Peace Village taught Gu Xian’er quite well.</p>
      <p>
        Although she was a bit silly at ordinary times, she was sharp when it
        counted.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s impossible for ordinary people to seek treasure that she’s taken
        for herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        How many people would have been deceived by this one act of hers alone?
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I’ll speak plainly. Your Origin has been damaged, so it would be
          best if you cultivate and consume Origin-healing medicine. If you
          trade me more Divine Weapons, then I will not suffer. Five of them for
          an additional healing pill would do, a fair trade given that I do not
          wish to take advantage of someone who is injured.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er earnestly spoke out, her beautiful eyes staring at Gu
        Changge.
      </p>
      <p>She showed not a trace of shame.</p>
      <p>‘This brat…’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Suffer what? One medicine for ten divine weapons is not a loss at all?
        It’s a steal?’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I would advise you to think carefully in my presence, Gu Xian’er,
          the inability to do so would be simply courting death.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge changed the subject abruptly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a sentence that obviously caused Gu Xian'er's expression to
        immediately stagnate.
      </p>
      <p>She almost forgot.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was her biggest enemy. Why was she even bargaining with him
        like this?
      </p>
      <p>
        However, she honestly did not believe that Gu Changge would kill her.
      </p>
      <p>Her face showed a complicated look.</p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, can’t you just tell me the truth?” </b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“What truth?”</b> Gu Changge asked back, acting ignorant of her
        intentions.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Really? At this time, it's already so obvious...”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian'er frowned. She suddenly felt that Gu Changge was quite the
        stubborn figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I don't understand what you're talking about, Gu Xian'er. You think
          too much.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>Gu Xian'er felt that Gu Changge's expression had chilled.</p>
      <p>Obviously, Gu Changge didn't want to talk about these matters.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“My goal is to seek revenge on you and eventually kill you. Yet, you
          haven’t attempted to kill me, and you’ve instead protected me multiple
          times. Are you trying to make amends for what happened in the
          past?”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Her emotions rushed out completely as Gu Xian’er rushed through her
        words.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“You shouldn’t think of yourself so highly, Gu Xian’er. The reason
          you aren’t dead right now is because I'm the Young Master and the Heir
          of the Gu Family, so I must naturally take into account the overall
          situation and the face of the Gu family before acting.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Besides. You think I won’t kill you? What a joke. If not for your
          strong backing and your troublesome nature, I would’ve slaughtered you
          already.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge just laughed when he heard her suspicions and doubts, as if
        cruelly mocking Gu Xian'er's ignorance and innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
        These words were half-true, half-false, possessing an underlying
        meaning.
      </p>
      <p>Plus, would Gu Xian’er believe him if he told the truth?</p>
      <p>Gu Changge wanted to see how she’d react.</p>
      <p><b>“Gu Changge, stop lying...”</b></p>
      <p>The petite girl’s face paled as she took in his words.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er had realized that Gu Changge would not tell her the truth,
        but she did not expect him to act so cold and heartless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this hurtful speech was within her expectations, Heaven
        knows how she might have reacted to it otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“I will definitely investigate this matter, but this does not settle
          the grudge between us. Just you wait, Gu Changge!”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er laid down her ultimatum. She had achieved her purpose in
        visiting Gu Changge, so it was only natural that she was ready to leave.
      </p>
      <p>There was nothing else to say.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge looked at her, pondering slightly, a flash of interest
        sparking in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>This reaction was not what he expected.</p>
      <p><b>“Master, something is wrong...”</b></p>
      <p>Outside the main hall, came the sound of a slightly frantic report.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er was about to leave, but her footsteps stopped. The girl’s
        retreating figure lingered for a bit.
      </p>
      <p>She was a little curious.</p>
      <p>
        ‘Is there something wrong? What would Gu Changge consider to be a major
        event?’
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“What's the matter?”</b> Gu Changge questioned the lackey calmly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Three hundred miles away, a large number of natives of the Ancient
          Immortal Races have appeared, gathering on a mountain peak. Judging by
          their positions, it seems like they are preparing to attack us.” </b
        >The follower outside the hall respectfully reported.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Those beasts? Another group of people </b><b>courting death</b
        ><b>?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge frowned slightly.</p>
      <p>
        The natives of the Ancient Immortal Continent were quite sly to take
        advantage of his ‘severely injured’ state to finish him off.
      </p>
      <p>‘Very bold!’</p>
      <p>
        If not for his ‘recuperation’, Gu Changge would have already led a group
        of followers to slaughter the Ancient Immortal Races all the way down to
        their roots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet somehow, trouble had come to find him instead. Which clan dared act
        so recklessly?
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge's eyes quickly fell on the Gu Xian'er shifting about in front
        of him.
      </p>
      <p>‘That’s right. There’s a free thug for use here.’</p>
      <p><b>“Which clan is it, have you seen clearly?”</b> Gu Changge asked.</p>
      <p>The responding person deliberated for a moment.</p>
      <p><b>“It seems to be the Tiangou Clan.”</b></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Ah, I didn't expect that the Tiangou Clans people would dare to step
          on me at this time...”</b
        >
        Gu Changge shook his head slightly, as if regretful.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Even dogs would bully a sick tiger” this situation was quite the
        spectacular way of proving this phrase.
      </p>
      <p>He then looked straight at Gu Xian'er.</p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Gu Changge, what are you looking at me for? Do you really think I’ll
          help you? Ridiculous.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er felt chills all over her body. It was as if an ominous being
        had targeted her.
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge must be plotting something.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“It’s alright. You’ll help in the end.”</b> Gu Changge's smiled with
        a bit of mystery.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Humph! In your dreams.”</b></p>
      <p>
        Gu Xian’er swiftly strode out of the palace, intending to leave right
        away, in accordance with her original plan. She didn’t want to stay with
        the bad luck charm known as ‘Gu Changge’ any longer.
      </p>
      <p>Today, she was really pissed off by Gu Changge.</p>
      <p>
        However, at least she managed to see through the severity of Gu
        Changge’s injury. It was serious, but not life threatening, which made
        her more or less relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge must not be killed by others before her revenge is fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“Master, what should we do about creatures of the Tiangou Clan?”</b>
        After Gu Xian'er left, the follower outside the hall continued to ask.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, he looked carefully into the hall.</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's condition did not look good.</p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the Tiangou Clan was aggressive, and they won’t be easily
        dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the Young Supremes had spat their promises and vows to show
        up to help if need be, yet were nowhere to be seen now. To be fair, the
        Ancient Immortal Continent wasn’t a playground where people could afford
        to be so altruistic anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“If you can catch them alive, then do so. If not, just kill them.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge casually commanded his follower, clearing not putting the
        lives of those creatures in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p><b>“Yes, Master.”</b> The follower stepped back.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge proceeded to hand him a crystalline pill beaming with a faint
        sword light.
      </p>
      <p>
        It carried a intent of the Sword Qi forged using his real cultivation.
      </p>
      <p>Relatively speaking, it wasn’t that strong.</p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, after one crushes the pill, the erupting divine energy
        that ensues could still obliterate those at the Half-Step of the Sacred
        Realm within seconds, wiping them from existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the perspective of the outside world, this method was nothing more
        than a result of Gu Changge’s terrifying heritage. It would be difficult
        to procure another once one is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, the younger generation of the various clans of the Ancient
        Immortal Continent would engage in a fruitless war of attrition,
        attempting to further consume his ‘trump cards.’
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘How pitiful…’ Unknown to the enemy, Gu Changge could effortlessly
        create a practically infinite amount of these so-called ‘trump cards.’
      </p>
      <p>
        The Sword Qi concealed inside the pill was at a very high level too. In
        the younger generation, there were none who possessed the means to block
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, the Ancient Immortal Races’ actions were akin to gifting him the
        heads of their own people at no cost, a truly foolish endeavour.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s just that Gu Xian’er was supremely unlucky, and was immediately
        caught in the crossfire the moment she stepped out of the palace
        grounds.
      </p>
      <p>‘Does she really think that she could go home without incident?’</p>
      <p>
        ‘Even if Xian'er doesn’t take the initiative, she would be forced to
        take action by the angry creatures of the Tiangou Clan, who harboured a
        grudge against all humans.’
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, Gu Changge left the hall and went outside the ruins to
        enjoy the show.
      </p>
      <p>———</p>
      <p><b>[Near the ruins]</b></p>
      <p>
        The battle had raged on for quite some time, with various runic lights
        rushing across the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with the attack pill given by Gu Changge, the battles tended to be
        more similar to one-sided massacres than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mighty Tiangou clansmen collapsed and exploded one after another
        under the light of his sword intent, creating fogs of blood that filled
        the sky.
      </p>
      <p>‘Ah. How chilly the mountain wind is...’</p>
      <p>Gu Changge's features slowly became paler and weaker.</p>
      <p>
        He covered his mouth with a plain white handkerchief and coughed, before
        the followers behind him hurriedly arrived with a stone chair for him to
        rest on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b
          >“Xian’er. Don’t blame your brother for the ruthless training. This is
          for your own good.”</b
        >
        Gu Changge narrowed his eyes with growing interest as he stared right at
        the frustrated Gu Xian’er who was embroiled in a battle of
        life-and-death.

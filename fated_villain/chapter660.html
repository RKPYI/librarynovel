        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s time someone else reigns over the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty.&#8221;</span><span id="more-34825"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terror struck Emperor Yu as chills coursed through his body.  While coldness overtook his limbs, he stood frozen stiff within the massive fog, not daring to move, and the approaching Gu Changge only made it eerier and suffocating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only had he always been trusting towards Gu Changge before this, but he even wanted his daughter, Yu Feiya, to actively approach Gu Changge. Hence, he was utterly shocked that the young man would show up at this very moment and make such a declaration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Can it be that Gu Changge deliberately had the men in black attack him? And his injury too… Could they also be fake? So as to lull people into a false sense of security!?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chills ran down Emperor Yu&#8217;s spine as he shuddered at the terrifying possibility. Though he was the ruler of an Immortal Celestial Dynasty, this didn&#8217;t stop fear from overwhelming him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Just how terrifyingly scheming is he to be able to control everything in the dark!?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, Emperor Yu was no common man, and he quickly collected himself after chuckling bitterly. Then, he shifted his gaze towards Yu Tianzheng and Gu Changge, saying, &#8220;to think Gu Changge is your backer. No doubt, Gu Channge, you must have been the one behind all of the recent chaos. You&#8217;re the real instigator, huh? Who&#8217;d have thought you&#8217;d stay so well hidden. Who&#8217;d have thought… Gu Changge, you are the biggest disaster in this whole realm!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a good grasp of Gu Changge&#8217;s character. No doubt the young man wasn&#8217;t worried about him getting away when he dared make himself known so publicly. [Looks like this will be the end of me.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was so powerful that he could even annihilate a World’s Will, a being nearly equal to an Immortal. Thus, it would be a piece of cake for the young man if he wanted to kill him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless he could fully awaken the National Weapon in his hands, he could forget about ever resisting Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Good to see that you&#8217;re not all that dumb. It&#8217;s high time the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty is handed to me,&#8221; sneered Yu Tianzheng as he quickly swallowed a few pills to heal up. Then, his body was enveloped in a glow, and his energy was recovering speedily.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way Yu Tianzheng saw it, Gu Changge&#8217;s appearance foretold the ending of the situation. No variant would occur. Even if Emperor Yu had all the schemes in the world, the era of his rule would end here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I knew it! You have sought refuge under Gu Changge! Don&#8217;t tell me you intend to hand over the whole Dynasty to him!&#8221; Emperor Yu blew a fuse, sounding disappointed but mostly indignant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Gu Changge hadn&#8217;t intervened, he would&#8217;ve already killed Yu Tianzheng by now, and none of all this extra nonsense would occur. Then again, it all boiled down to his foolishness at the end of the day. Gu Changge had him wrapped around his little fingers, and he was oblivious to the man&#8217;s schemes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gu Changge shook his head with a profound and impassive gaze while asking, &#8220;Do you want me to kill you, or do you want to do it yourself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I should&#8217;ve listened to Feiya a long time ago…&#8221; Grimness enveloped Emperor Yu as he regretted not listening to his daughter back when she warned him of Gu Changge. If Gu Changge really faked his injury, all that had happened in Profound Sword World was likely mostly clandestine, and the deaths of the many True Daoists would forever be a mystery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Enough words. You will die today, and there&#8217;s nothing anybody can do about it!&#8221; Yu Tianzheng roared in anger as his Qi and blood boiled. Endless runes surfaced as he charged towards Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* The area exploded once more, causing a massive shockwave that seemingly reformed the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Like I&#8217;ll let it happen!&#8221; roared Emperor Yu as endless blood burst out from within him. He knew he would die one way or the other. Hence, he decided to make a last-ditch effort and revive the Chaos Dao Sword.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endless sword rays ripped the darkness, pervaded out of the area, and shot to the skies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, chaotic Imperial Qi filled the depths of the sky as the Dao Sword released a never-ending ray.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sharp edge gleamed, looking like it had been suppressed since the beginning of time as slivers of Imperial Qi trailed down, wanting to shield Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a National Weapon of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. The way it was produced was incredibly unique. Hence, it could hold its own just fine against even an Immortal Grade Artifact.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the divine power within the sword was roused by Emperor Yu, with brilliant light burst out, shining down on the entire world as it stirred to kill all its enemies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Buzz!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a quaint and mysterious black hole-like rune enveloped in the might of the Great Dai flew out from within the void. It made the Dao Sword tremble ceaselessly. Even the awakening divine power gradually dimmed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What in the world…&#8221; Emperor Yu was beyond terrified, and his voice trembled with terror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how he attempted to reawaken the divine power within the Dao Sword, it was of no use.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Gu Changge was doing was too profound to comprehend.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Making a last-ditch effort? Just give up already,&#8221; monotoned Gu Changge as he reached his hand out with an unfathomable gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The space in front crumbled instantly, leading to endless astral winds, with chaotic light bursting out, disintegrating all physical material.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chills ran down Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s spine as he felt lowly like an ant. If he didn&#8217;t evade, the shock wave created by Gu Changge&#8217;s attack would certainly kill him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Is this Gu Changge&#8217;s true strength?] Unadulterated fear shrouded him, and he finally realised what despair was.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Emperor Yu roared furiously as countless slivers of Imperial Qi wreathed, and a sea of Principles surged within him. The embroideries on his clothes roused and emerged to block the attack. Nevertheless, all these efforts were nothing against Gu Changge&#8217;s palm strike. It all disintegrated instantly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was absolute oppression. A gulf, like those between a god and a mortal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Boom!* Blood splattered everywhere and was quickly absorbed by the massive mist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emperor Yu felt absolutely hopeless. Even when he had used every trick in his book, he still exploded to bits under Gu Changge&#8217;s attack. Even his soul disintegrated into nothingness. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Emperor of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, he had many objects that ensured his survival, not to mention when he held the Dao Sword, he should be invincible. However, his opponent was Gu Changge. The outcome of the battle had been decided from the get-go. No variants would ever happen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for helping me, Young Master Gu,&#8221; said Yu Tianzheng with a flushed face and a shaking body, while in cloud nine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he didn&#8217;t manage to kill Emperor Yu himself, it was good enough for him to see the man die before his eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, years of hatred and animosity had come to a close.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Gu Changge was barely ruffled, for killing Emperor Yu to him wouldn&#8217;t change anything. Well, his clout would be affected, but killing the Emperor was no different from crushing an ant. Sure, he had the Chaos Dao Sword, which drew power from the Dynasty, but he was ultimately just a Quasi-Nirvana Realm expert and not a True Daoist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving the rest to you. Don&#8217;t let me down again.&#8221; Gu Changge disappeared in a flash, as though he was never there, after taking a gander at Yu Tianzheng.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was only the beginning of the chaos in Great Yu Celestial Dynasty, and he was merely driving things ahead in the shadows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Emperor Yu had fallen, chaos would certainly ceaselessly plague the lands. But at the same time, it was also the perfect time for Yu Tianzheng to seize the throne and rule over the Dynasty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than him, no one else would know what happened this very night, nor would they know the tragic death of Emperor Yu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, to those outside, Gu Changge was suffering a severe injury and was even attacked by a group of men in black. None would think to connect all of that to Emperor Yu&#8217;s assassination, and certainly no one would assume he would have anything to do with this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Young Master Gu. Leave the rest to me,&#8221; said Yu Tianzheng as he nodded solemnly in the direction Gu Changge left.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Followingly, he swept his feverish gaze across the many objects left behind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Emperor Yu was gone, the Dao Sword and the other things he left were now Yu Tianzheng&#8217;s by default. After all, his and Emperor Yu&#8217;s cultivation derived from the same origin. Hence, it was only normal that he could wield the sword, and the other cultivators, especially the True Daoists, could forget about ever seizing it from him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge certainly wouldn&#8217;t claim something like this. On the one hand, he didn&#8217;t lack any, and on the other, claiming the sword would imply he attacked and killed Emperor Yu. Risking such things to get the sword really wasn&#8217;t worth it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is the best scenario. Looks like the men in black were really a part of Young Master Gu&#8217;s plan. Well, it has helped me either way. Many will certainly assume them to be under Emperor Yu&#8217;s command. But dead men tell no tales…&#8221;  Yu Tianzheng sneered as he looked down through the mist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had ceased the fight there long ago. Hence, not even a True Daoist could find anything, even if they personally recollected the scene using their secret technique.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, it would give the people an illusion that he killed Emperor Yu using some terrifying attack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Eek, eek, eek…* The massive mist from nowhere remained to in the sky, enveloping the entire Imperial Capital and clouding all the cultivators&#8217; senses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, not even the True Daoist could tell what was going on inside.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other cultivators had long sunken into the darkness. As nothing but darkness was ahead of them, the only thing they had in mind was to leave this place. None of them had a clue what had happened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, signs ultimately still showed following Emperor Yu&#8217;s death—a bloody rain poured.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many terrifying images were reflected in the skies of the Great Yu Celestial Dynasty. Demons cried, monks looked up, and the stars and moon crumbled.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the reigning Great Yu Celestial Dynasty Emperor, his life was inextricably linked to the Fortuity and Faith of the trillions of living beings here. The implication was so vast that it was unimaginable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, all those in the Capital were dumbfounded. They were even wondering if their eyes were playing tricks on them. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, all the princes and princesses were stupefied, standing rooted to their spots with heads buzzing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;H-How… How can this be…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;His Majesty has fallen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some ministers who had come to their senses were still stupefied, and their trembling voices were filled with fear and sadness, having a hard time believing all of this was real. In their heads, the winner of this battle was evident. Emperor Yu should be able to kill Yu Tianzheng easily, not to mention that he had arranged for backup. So how could he have possibly died!?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a moment, howls and wails filled the entire Dynasty. No one believed their invincible Emperor was killed by his mortal enemy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many screamed in grave agony. Some even nearly passed out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those from other Forces, too, were incredibly shocked and filled with mixed emotions, No one expected such an outcome from this battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How could Father have died? This is impossible…&#8221; Yu Feiya&#8217;s face blanched. Her fists clenched so tightly that her knuckles were cracking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Emperor Yu was incredibly selfish and only ever cared about benefits to the Royal Family, so much so that he was willing to use her as a token for exchange, he was still her father. The revelation of his sudden death caused her to nearly black out.</span></p>

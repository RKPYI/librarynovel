          drastically as they felt a chill run through their bodies, which made
          many tremble. [The strength of that bodyguard beside Gu Changge had
          definitely surpassed the Sacred Emperor Realm! Looks like no one will
          be able to escape unscathed today.]

          >Naturally, Chan Hongyi understood the meaning of Gu Changge’s words.
          However, at that moment, there was only hatred in her eyes. There were
          no other emotions. She wished that she could kill this man in front of
          her.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Why did you do this to me?” Her terrifying hostility reappeared once
          again. It was like a sea of blood, ready to drown Gu Changge. However,
          Gu Changge just waved his sleeves. His airy robe was like a refined
          piece of the universe that contained a myriad of mysteries. There
          seemed to be stars rotating and the universes manifesting, as the
          attack struck Chan Hongyi.

          rage. With what little strength that she had left, she was of no
          threat to him anymore.

          >“Gu Changge…Who exactly are you?” Many looked towards him in
          disbelief and they couldn’t help but tremble. The Demoness actually
          spoke again and this time, her words were definitely meant for him.
          Doesn’t this mean that, earlier, outside the Divine City, she was not
          muttering to herself? Instead, this whole time, she had already sensed
          Gu Changge’s aura and was talking to him? After she left the
          Demon-Burying Abyss, she has been going after someone, and it turned
          out to be Gu Changge!?

          casually glanced at the crowd behind him. Yet, he didn’t say anything
          and only gave one command to Ah Da. Gu Changge was fine with letting
          them know a little more as he never intended on letting these people
          live.</span

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Yes, Master.” Ah Da received the command as his pupils remained
          abnormally cold. A spear fell and pierced through the sky. It was as
          though it destroyed the world. The void remained still as continuous
          black light flooded the scene.

          He couldn’t help but fall backwards as he tried to avoid the flood of
          black light.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“No…” He desperately tried everything he could. his aura and
          techniques inundated the air. However, it was hopeless. He never
          imagined he would die here and his heart was filled with bitterness
          and regret. If he had known earlier, he wouldn’t have been greedy for
          the Demoness’ flesh and blood.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A terrifying sound echoed through the sky after the strong shockwave
          that reverberated through the ground. The golden shield that the old
          monster had used to protect himself exploded as Ah Da’s spear pierced
          through it and through his body, carrying him far away into the void
          like candied haws. Then, with a slight tremble of Ah Da’s arm, the
          blood from the old monster’s veins exploded and rained down.
          Naturally, it had split the corpse into many pieces. The remaining
          bystanders also changed their expressions as they were shocked to the
          core. In their hearts, they were cursing Gu Changge out. But, they
          still couldn’t hide their fear, which sent chills down their spines.
        </span>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were shocked by what Gu Changge said to the Demoness. However,
          now was not the time for them to think about this. They were facing
          the biggest crisis of their lifetime. Ah Da was in the Quasi-Nirvana
          Realm and in his current state, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to
          kill everyone present. Not to mention, everyone&#8217;s Source had
          been damaged in some way and they had little Qi left. Thus, they were
          far from their peak state. Gu Changge looked back at the horrified
          crowd and with a calm expression on his face, he asked “Now, do all of
          you understand? She is not something you can covet.”

          fact that Gu Changge’s Qi had not changed by much since the start.
          Things immediately clicked. They were angry and terrified, [No wonder
          he volunteered to guard the eye of the formation. It turns out that he
          had done so deliberately for his own scheme! He must have done
          something to cause all our Qi to deplete at an alarming rate. We were
          fools to not have realised anything! Now that things have come to
          this, it’s obviously all a ploy he came up with!]</span

          reverie. Their expressions had become dreadful and they glared at Gu
          Changge in rage. Even for them, it was too difficult to maintain their
          usual composure. At the same time, they took out a few Buddhist
          artifacts. Dazzling Buddha aura burst forth and shone in all
          directions. This caused the sky to look crystal-clear.

          spiritual manifestations such as the Wrathful Vajra, Even the
          Compassionate Buddha and Bodhisattva appeared. They chanted Buddhist
          scriptures in an attempt to save those who were still alive. This was
          unimaginable Dharmic Power because it contained the Intent to save all
          living beings. It was the greatest power Buddhist Mountain possessed.

          Zen Robe, but they were all wrong. His actual motive was to release
          the Demoness! Furthermore, he framed his actions on them! How could
          they possibly let go of this grudge?

          for sure. All of you will die here today. None of your bodies nor
          souls will be left.” Gu Changge smiled. His words were as casual as
          though killing them was akin to killing ants.

          pupils shot daggers at him. Her terrifying evil spirits soared into
          the sky and turned into billowing blood clouds behind her. However,
          with so much Dharmic Power and Dao Energy in front of her, it was
          indeed difficult for her to resist. Especially in her current state,
          where her old wound had reopened and there were several cracks on her

          moved backwards, afraid to confront Ah Da head-on. They didn’t think

          hands held onto various plain Buddhist treasures that spouted
          boundless rays of light. It made it seem as though the stars flooded
          towards Gu Changge.

        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >*Dang!* Accompanied by a terrifying sound, it pierced through the
          sky. A small golden pagoda appeared above Gu Changge’s head. This was
          the Tower of World Domination with nine floors. One by one, celestial
          writing appeared. As they fell, they extended continuously as vast
          golden light surged and bloomed. The body of the tower was plain yet
          natural.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >With a slight shake, the monks coughed up blood and flew backwards.
          It was practically impossible for them to attack Gu Changge head-on.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What…” </span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“The Tower of World Domination has fallen into Gu Changge’s hands!”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They were stunned, but remembered that Gu Changge had a trove of
          endless treasures. He even had a few of the Seven Tools of World
          Domination. The defensive power of the Tower of World Domination was
          extremely terrifying. According to the legend, the Tower of World
          Domination was once the object that suppressed the Immortal Palace’s
          Fortuity.

          >“No matter what you do, death awaits you so why must you put yourself
          through so much trouble?” Gu Changge gently nodded his head, his tone
          seemed to express sympathy towards them.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The next moment, a long black spear appeared in his hand. One by one,
          Nirvana Realm Principles emerged and they were incomparably majestic,
          as if they could transform into an unrivalled emperor to attack the
          world. The vast black blade aura swept across and the rays of light
          gushed out. One after another, runes condensed and swept across the
          sky and earth.</span

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Within a split second, the monks from Buddhist Mountain started to
          cough out blood continuously and all their Buddhist treasures were
          destroyed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >They weren’t Gu Changge’s match at all. Even True Daoists would
          quiver and back off in front of this blade. Within the monks from
          Buddhist mountain, the one with the highest cultivation was at most in
          the Third-Order Quasi-Nirvana Realm, that was still far from being a
          True Daoist.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Suddenly, blood rained down and many people screamed in terror as
          they exploded with regret, despair and bitterness. Soon after, their
          bodies and souls were completely annihilated.
        </span>

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chan Hongyi silently watched as Gu Changge committed mass murder
          within seconds. At the same time, she devoured all the Life Force
          available to her. Thick red beacons that shot up into the sky and
          covered all directions, gathered towards her. The blood mist drifted
          and soon, only the two of them were left here as Ah Da had obediently
          retreated.

          >“It is finally quiet. After so many years, don’t you have anything to
          say to me?” Gu Changge kept the Solar Heavenly Blade and gently
          descended from the sky. His robes were flowy and spotless, it looked
          as though he didn’t just return from committing mass murder. He smiled
          casually and strode towardsChan Hongyi, with the relaxation that one
          usually had when they conversed with an old friend.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >When Chan Hongyi saw Gu Changge approaching, the terrifying hostility
          reappeared in her eyes as deep hatred filled her bones. The murderous
          aura filled the area and shattered the sky. “I am going to kill you.”
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >It was just a cold and indifferent short sentence, without any
          emotions. A frightening energy energy emerged from her body, as though
          she wanted to recreate the bloody scene from just now. After she had
          devoured the many Life Forces around, her wounds had indeed healed but
          for her old wound, doing so would only suppress it. Nonetheless, it
          was much better as compared to when she first left the Demon-Burying
          Abyss.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>

          indifferent, changed.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“You…” Chan Hongyi glared at Gu Changge as the hostility in her
          expression increased and she felt as though something else was mixed
          into these Life Force. It caused her to be unable to mobilise her Qi.
          The effect was temporary and she could quickly resolve it. However,
          this small opening could change a lot of things.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Do you feel like you can’t utilise your Qi? Then, just go get some
          sleep.” As he noticed her expression change, he couldn’t help but
          chuckle.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >A moon-white Zen Robe filled with Buddha aura appeared in his palm.
          It was as though there were many enlightened monks that were chanting
          scriptures day and night to strengthen its Dharmic Power. Buddha aura
          shone downwards and graced upon Chan Hongyi’s face. Her hostility
          melted away, like snow that met the scorching sun. At that moment, the
          Zen Robe glowed brightly as thousands of rays of Buddha aura shot out.
          Coloured bloomed from the robe, as if it was washing away the demonic
          energy from her body.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“This should be able to suppress the hostility caused from killing so
          many people.” Gu Changge narrowed his eyes and placed the Zen Robe on
          her body. Wisps of her hostility dissipated and sizzled like green
          smoke. Her face gradually calmed down as she glanced around in
          confusion. Then, she looked down on her blood-stained palms and
          clothes, which made her puzzled.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Master…Master…” The Chan Hongyi couldn’t help but mutter as she
          looked towards the young man with the familiar aura. He was an
          extremely important person to her. Although she forgot many things,
          these two words came out of her mouth naturally. They had already been
          imprinted into her very being and couldn’t be erased. She stretched
          out her slender white hands, as if she wanted to reach out for him.
          However, she shrank back out of habit, worried that it would activate
          the ‘arrays’ which might injure them.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“We’re already outside.” Gu Changge smiled and grabbed her white
          slender hands. He took out a clean embroidered handkerchief from his
          robes and gently wiped away the traces of blood on her face and hands.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chan Hongyi looked around in a daze, her obsidian-like eyes showing
          confusion. She turned her head to the side with her black hair
          drooping down, “Out…outside?”.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Mhm, outside.” Gu Changge nodded his head.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Master…Master, it hurts…it hurts…” In a soft voice, Chan Hongyi
          suddenly pulled away. Gu Changge gazed at the crack on her hand. It
          was unknown how the injury came about. It had been there for a very
          long time and was extremely difficult to heal. Previously, it was
          caused by many different energies damaging her. Furthermore, after
          today’s battle, the wound reopened and it frightened her.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >The Chan Hongyi before couldn’t feel pain at all. After all, she was
          consumed by boundless malice and murderous intent. Even if there were
          cracks in her body, her expression would remain the same as if she
          didn’t know what pain was.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >However, for the current her, who obviously could feel pain, her face
          became slightly pale and she tightly bit her lip. She was dazed and
          confused as to why it hurt so much.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >His expression became soft and wisps of gentle Qi converged and
          transformed into heavenly mist, which contained the Energy of Creation
          for his Purifying Nirvana Lotus Body, which contained an astonishing
          amount of vitality.

      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >“Mm…it…it doesn’t hurt anymore.” Accompanied by the sound of
          chirping, wisps of green smoke appeared above her wound.

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Chan Hongyi turned pale and her brows furrowed due to the pain, but
          she still nodded to her Master. She still remembered how she was once
          punished by him because she got into a fight and got an unbearably
          painful injury. Thus, even if she was in an unbearable amount of pain,
          she would nod and say that she was okay.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: 400"
          >Gu Changge looked at her and gently nodded his head because he
          understood why she would say so. In his opinion, a large part why Chan
          Hongyi had two split personalities was because she was sealed in the
          Demon-Burying Abyss for far too long. Only by not knowing pain and
          fear and having hatred, could help her to resist the loneliness and
          hurt.

          rainbows as they left.

      <p>

          >Within the radius of hundreds of thousands of kilometres, the blood
          mist remained in the atmosphere and broken artifacts were scattered
          everywhere. The area was now home to dead ruins.

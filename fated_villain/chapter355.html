          his attack was terrifying enough to cause thousands of stars to

          were no match for it, and the being immediately exploded to pieces.
          Many of various cultivation levels also got crushed, as their bodies
          and souls were annihilated. They were no different from ants under

          Mansion, he must be a True Daoist at the very least!&#8221;</span

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the depths of Vermilion Bird Hall, there was a spectacular palace covered in clouds, resembling the Celestial Realm. Under the moonlight, the lake shimmered, seeming even more crystalline than usual, though around it, there was nothing but silence.</span><span id="more-36145"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, everyone widened their eyes in shock as they peered at the scene in fear.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing&#8217;s identity in Vermilion Bird Hall was no secret to the entire Battlefield of Hundred Worlds. All the locals surely recognised her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, to everyone&#8217;s surprise, the prominent lady of the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds was now accompanying a young man by her side. Given what happened in Border City yesterday, the identity of the man in white must be inexplicable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young… Young Master Gu…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why is he here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s minds rang as their widely open eyes glued to the astounding sight. None of them had expected to see Gu Changge in person in their lifetime.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is really Young Master Gu… they are doomed…&#8221; Feeling suffocated, the powerful figures hiding in the dark dared not to hide themselves any longer and hastily appeared with reverent looks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluntly put, as of now, Gu Changge was undeniably the most influential person in the entirety of the Upper Realm. There was no one else like him. All he needed was one word to reshape the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Sect Masters and ancient beings of various Immortal and Formidable Forces had to be wary and courteous in front of him, while ordinary cultivators could barely stand properly before him. Naturally, the smug disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans were the prime example.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the crowd, them causing the young woman in red to land right in front of Gu Changge and thus getting in his way was an indication of them being sick of living.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At once, the surrounding cultivators looked at the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans with sympathy, while some donned gloating expressions. Essentially, the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans were uncontrollably rampant, and now, they finally ran out of luck, which should teach them to keep themselves in check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[What happened? Why did the attitude of the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans suddenly change? Who is this young woman and this man in white?]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those of Blue Flood Ancient World, who were idly awaiting their deaths, were thoroughly dumbfounded by the unexpected scene, turning around with their widened, confused eyes. To them, they were supposed to be dead by now, and even their Masters and Elders behind them wouldn&#8217;t be able to save them. Nevertheless, judging by the current situation, the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans seemed absolutely fearful, as though they just offended some sort of terrorising being.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, please forgive us for our unintentional disruption. Please spare our lives…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In front of the arena palace, the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans peered at Gu Changge, who was not far away, with their blanched faces as they trembled so violently that their souls almost left their bodies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan, who attacked Xue Yan, collapsed to the ground, frantically shaking. His face was extremely pale as though he lost all the blood in his body. Even the Clan Head behind him dared not to save him, revealing a dejected expression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Since you sought death, no one shall save you.&#8221; Ah Qing coldly glared at the disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan who assaulted Xue Yan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn&#8217;t even need to give any instructions. Her subordinates that were following her in the dark immediately showed up, forming a shadow that stormed towards the disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan before instantaneously taking him away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a scream of terror and despair, a splash was heard on the clear and mirror-like surface of a distant lake. Then, as a loud thump sounded, blood suddenly spattered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Menacing beasts leapt out from the depths of the lake as if they were sharks that smelt blood, opening their bloodthirsty mouths and biting into that disciple in an instant. The frightening force of their bite was equal to the weight of a mountain, instantly breaking his bones and organs as they gnawed him into a puddle of blood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He died just like that…&#8221; Seeing that, the crowd couldn&#8217;t help but silently shiver in fear. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, numerous daunting beasts were hiding in the depths of the lake, and the arrogant disciple of the Ancient Royal Clan was turned into their meal in the blink of an eye, dying with a shredded body.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon that sight, the remaining disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans were pale-faced and equally terrified, worried that they would be caught and fed to these beasts like their companion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu, what should we do with them?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having grown up on the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds, Ah Qing was naturally not someone who was easy to go up against as she had witnessed all kinds of murders and gore. Thus, killing these disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans was nothing to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, with Gu Changge backing her up now, she wouldn&#8217;t even blink if she were to slaughter the Elders and Successors of the Ancient Royal Clans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she asked the question, she frostily scanned all the cultivators in front of her. Even the important figures dared not to meet her gaze, lowering their heads in restlessness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Forget it. Since they didn&#8217;t mean it, and I am no murderous man, their lives shall be spared.&#8221; In response, Gu Changge gently shook his head, his expression unchanged. Although he originally planned to watch the commotion from afar without getting involved, he didn&#8217;t expect the woman in red to fly over and fall right in front of him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, he was more interested in the other young man as he was a genuine Fortuitous One. Besides, he also possessed a decent amount of Cyan Fortuity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, given Gu Changge&#8217;s current cultivation level, he was no longer interested in ordinary Fortuitous Ones, since he wouldn&#8217;t be able to obtain much Fortuity and Fatums even he were to kill them, which gradually diminished the System&#8217;s presence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for your generosity, Young Master Gu. Thank you for sparing our lives!&#8221; On the other hand, hearing that Gu Changge decided to forgive them, the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans felt highly relieved, kneeling down in gratitude.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, they still felt awfully remorseful for their companion who was tossed into the lake and became the beasts&#8217; food. If it weren&#8217;t for those of Blue Flood Ancient World, they wouldn&#8217;t have upset Gu Changge for no reason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the surrounding people were anticipating a dramatic turn of event, only to be disappointed by how Gu Changge easily forwent the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless, following Gu Changge&#8217;s appearance, the nearby influential figures gradually approached him. It didn&#8217;t matter whether he was willing to entertain them as long as they came to pay their respect so as not to leave a bad impression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indubitably, many were curious about Gu Changge&#8217;s sudden visit to the Battlefield of Hundred World, or rather, to the battle arena.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Did he come to look for new followers or perhaps slaves?] The crowd inferred, bearing complicated emotions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, numerous cultivators lurking in the shadows silently delivered the news to their respective Forces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the humongous size of the Vermilion Bird Hall, there were many unknown, troublesome Forces depending on each other despite their allegiance to different factions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for your help, P—Young Master Gu…&#8221; As Xue Yan realised that the hazard was resolved, she quickly came to her senses and thanked Gu Changge with a courteous gesture. Not knowing how to address Gu Changge, she was about to say ‘Prince’, but fearing that she&#8217;d be perceived as trying too hard to get close to him, she hurriedly shifted her words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you for saving us, Young Master Gu. We are eternally grateful.&#8221; Seeing that, the rest of the young prodigies of Blue Flood Ancient World also came to their senses, swiftly dashing over to thank Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they were no fools, they could tell that Gu Changge, who was before them, bore a terrifying identity. In fact, he might have been the prominent figure they saw entering through the city gate in a carriage dragged by nine Azure Dragons this morning. Therefore, despite knowing that Gu Changge didn&#8217;t actually do anything in the matter, they didn&#8217;t want to give up the opportunity to talk to him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It is unbelievable for me to have the luck to be saved by you, Young Master Gu.&#8221; At that moment, even the man in scholarly robe who expected a gruesome death with a gloomy face was now exhilarated. Those of Blue Flood Ancient World might not know him, but he certainly did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re actually saved…&#8221; From afar, Lu Ming, who was covered in immense pain and blood stains, limped over with an incredulous look. He was prepared to fight to the death, but he never expected the disciples of the Ancient Royal Clans were so unlucky as to run into this mysterious and fearsome man before him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A bunch of lowly worms, do not come here and bother Young Master Gu. Get lost!&#8221; Ah Qing said coldly as she swept her gaze over those of Blue Flood Ancient World, treating them as absolute inferiors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it was her or other cultivators, their attitudes towards the young prodgies of the Lower Realm were how they would treat insignificant ants—with not the slightest respect. In her eyes, the swarm of puny insects were undoubtedly not worthy of talking to Gu Changge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah Qing, don&#8217;t be rude.&#8221; Hearing this, Gu Changge softly chuckled and interrupted her with a wave before landing his gaze on the woman in red dress and continuing to speak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This world has always been about survival of the fittest and natural selection. If you do not want this to repeat, then first train your fists. At the very least, you won&#8217;t fall so miserably as you have today.&#8221; As he spoke, he pulled out a clean handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to Xue Yan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;T—Thank you for the advice, Young Master Gu.&#8221; Xue Yan was somewhat dazed as stared at the handkerchief being offered to her with wide eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her petite face that paled due to her injuries suddenly reddened as she was taken aback. She never expected that Gu Changge would be so proactive in advising her and even handed her a clean handkerchief to wipe off the blood stain at the corner of her mouth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This&#8230; &#8221; At once, every nearby cultivator widened their eyes in disbelief, unable to believe what they were seeing. After realising what happened, they turned to Xue Yan with gazes of envy and jealousy, and even Ah Qing herself felt extremely jealous.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn&#8217;t fathom why Gu Changge would say such nice things to a worthless insect and even hand her a handkerchief. [Could it be because this girl is pretty? But one should know that in the Upper Realm, beautiful women are all over the place.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Junior Xue Yan&#8230;&#8221; Lu Ming, who limped over from afar, was also shocked by the sight as indescribable rage arose in his heart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logically speaking, they were saved and alive all thanks to Gu Changge. He should be grateful to him, yet for some reason, he felt strangely hostility towards him, as if they were fated enemies, especially after witnessing the interaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you&#8230; Thank you, Young Master Gu&#8230;&#8221; Under the envious and jealous glare of her companions, Xue Yan returned from her daze and hastily, warily accepted the handkerchief handed to her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her eyes, this was not just a simple handkerchief. After all, it was handed to her by Gu Changge right in front of everyone else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she knew nothing about Gu Changge&#8217;s identity, from the expressions of the people around her, she understood that after tonight, no one in the entirety of the Battlefield of Hundred Worlds would ever trouble her again, as even the powerful figures now directed amiable smiles towards her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, Xue Yan was baffled, wondering why she was this lucky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right when she was daydreaming, Gu Changge, along with Ah Qing, walked past her towards the depth of the palaces, as though they were simply helping out a beggar by the streets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardly conscious, Xue Yan, not even knowing where she mustered her courage from, turned around and asked Gu Changge, &#8220;Young Master Gu, may I perhaps have your name? If the opportunity arises in the future, I must repay you for your kindness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, she felt her heart rampantly palpitating. She was drowned in nervousness, as if she shouldn&#8217;t have asked such a question given her lowly status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon the question, everyone else grew even more envious. The woman who oddly gained Gu Changge&#8217;s notice didn&#8217;t even know his name. [How lucky is she? With such auspicious fortune, she&#8217;d be grinning even in her grave!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh? You don&#8217;t have to repay me or anything.&#8221; In response, Gu Changge revealed a faint smile without turning back, casually adding, &#8220;As for my name, I&#8217;m sure someone will tell you soon enough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, the servants of the battle arena respectfully walked over and led Gu Changge and his group into the establishment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Why would he do that…&#8221; Far away in the shadows, a dashing figure in black wearing a straw hat on her head was observing the event the whole time, only withdrawing her gaze when she saw Gu Changge enter the depths of the palace.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the young woman in red dress, she vaguely saw her former self. Back then, she also came from the Upper Realm and was belittled by countless cultivators. If it weren&#8217;t for Gu Changge&#8217;s favour, she would have suffered endless humiliation and torments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Gu…&#8221;  With that in mind, the agony and struggle in her eyes aggravated, followed by a surge of aggression that slowly smeared the remaining clarity in her eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, under the guidance of servants assigned by Ah Qing, Gu Changge swiftly entered the inner palace. Unlike the pavilions outside, this place was a spiralling passage to the underground.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the stairs, spiritual oil lamps were lit on both sides. The atmosphere was rather dull, and the battle arena should be underground.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The walls here are inscribed with arrays. If the arrays got triggered upon an emergency, they would unleash remarkable power that could trap cultivators in the Sacred Realm. Naturally, they should also prevent any accidents,&#8221; Qing Er explained when she noticed Gu Changge staring at the walls.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What a profound setup.&#8221; Gu Changge nodded, casually glancing across his surroundings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area was tremendously vast, similar to the layout of a beast arena, with seats on both sides. However, the arena was separated by a special barrier, preventing people from peeking at the other side.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one would expect such an elegant and tranquil island was actually hiding such an enormous battle arena where countless prisoners and cultivators died every single day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for why Gu Changge decided to help the woman in red dress earlier, it was simply to see if anything fascinating would happen between the Fortuitous One and his destined woman after he affected her emotions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, everything he had done earlier was solely out of his wicked nature.</span></p>

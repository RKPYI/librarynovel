        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slap traversed countless lands—as if a massive chunk of the world caved in—before striking the bloody eye, making it shudder ceaselessly as many terrifying, bloody cracks appeared.</span><span id="more-34811"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, shockwaves swept across the lands. The impact was so powerful that even the Profound Sword World&#8217;s world barrier began cracking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Looks like its powers aren&#8217;t in its prime because it has just awoken. If anything, it&#8217;s only as strong as a Remnant Immortal. It&#8217;ll benefit my cultivation significantly even if I can&#8217;t find the World Source.] Gu Changge gazed at the eye the World’s Will transformed into and stepped forward. The next second, the space beneath his feet disappeared as he flashed and appeared above the sky.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He made another attack, and the Eight Barren Demon Halberd immediately slashed across the eye, seemingly sweeping its power across the entire universe and breaking all Principles apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The light burst out, brilliant as though countless suns exploded simultaneously, unleashing immense energy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That instant, a majestic anomaly engulfed the world. Countless galaxies gathered as zillions of stars roamed and Chaos Qi showered down. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world seemingly collapsed in an instant, and crevasses that spanned across the horizon formed from where Gu Changge attacked. Catastrophic chains appeared through them one after another, penetrating everything with lightning speed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Crack…*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge attacked ceaselessly, causing various celestial beams to perish and obliterate Principles one after another. His white robe billowed as his sleeves snapped against the wind. He was like an unparalleled suave young Immortal Emperor, who overlooked the past and present with contempt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Die, thou disobeyer!&#8221; The eye the World&#8217;s Will transformed into remained impassive and merciless, and the countless cracks that formed on it seemed to have irritated it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As vast and majestic Heavenly Dao energy interwoven, the world and its beings, even those undergoing reincarnation, all manifested under the Dao light&#8217;s illumination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, many terrifying images appeared. Ancient tombstones manifested one after another as bronze coffins lay in the air, seemingly entombing countless sleeping Absolute Beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the Great Millstone of World Destruction descended and rolled ceaselessly, enveloped in black mist. As it advanced slowly, the entire world shook and crumbled following its movements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a catastrophic event. Not only had the world collapsed, but it even transformed into a terrifying great millstone with destruction energy. It crushed and swallowed all beings and turned them into boundless light rays.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since breaking free from its seal, the World&#8217;s Will has demonstrated unprecedented power. The great powers unleashed disillusioned life and death, caused rebirth to cease, as heaven crumbled, and the order of the world faded away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To it, Gu Changge&#8217;s existence and attacks were undoubtedly the biggest threat to its supremacy, and the severity was equivalent to the Heaven-Exterminating War.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the ending for both was night and day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, endless cultivators rushed fearlessly at it like a moth to fire. However, all of them were ultimately met with the same fate. They perished into ashes mid-air as their souls faded into nothingness. Gone were they forever from this world. Those who disobeyed would suffer excruciating pain for eternity, never to be reborn for life. They were to chant and kneel on the path to rebirth, never to reach it, having to eternally repent for their sins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Gu Changge was completely different from those disobeyers. His powers were far beyond what this world could contain. In fact, he even crushed the World Principles of this world. In other words, he wounded it substantially.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, countless Profound Sword World cultivators knelt on the ground and shuddered ceaselessly with nothing but fear on their faces.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a battle that shocked and stirred the entire Profound Sword World. The place turned catastrophic as endless Chaos Qi burst out, spreading towards the desolated edge of the universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entire space was pierced through, scarred gravely. Stars, too, fell from the skies one after another.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this a miracle or a massacre?&#8221; Countless knelt on the ground and bowed down in the direction of the shockwaves with fear and devotion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the Earth Sword Immortals, who stood at the peak of Profound Sword World, couldn&#8217;t help but want to kneel as well, for to them, a battle of this degree was beyond their perception, and if they could just take a peek at a sliver of its mystery, it would be enough for them to break through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ancient Arcane Ruins crumbled that instant, and a terrifying rift appeared, stretching towards all directions. Endless black mist surged overwhelmingly, engulfing the surrounding living beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mere moments, death took over the place, and the cultivators who failed to react were swallowed and turned into dust.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Looks like this is the World&#8217;s Will that we&#8217;ve been searching for high and low…&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the others speedily burst out from the small world and gazed hauntingly towards the terrifying shockwaves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were lucky Gu Changge&#8217;s attack shattered the barrier of the small world. So even if the entrance had been destroyed, they could still flee and avoid death. Among them who escaped was Lin En, who had recovered from his guilt and sadness. After calming down, he seethed with rage and animosity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew he had been duped by the World&#8217;s Will into unleashing it. The being was incredibly scheming. Who&#8217;d have thought it had been waiting for his arrival at Boundless Immortal Valley to initiate this plan?!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He never wished for things to come to this either, and now, the only way to undo all of this was to emulate his Ancestors and seal up the World&#8217;s Will once more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it looked less than improbable, it was all they could do now, or the World&#8217;s Will would once again destroy the entire Profound Sword World to Transcend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When that time comes, no one, not even he, would survive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What in the world is going on?!&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal couldn&#8217;t help asking as he gazed at Lin En. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of them had a clue what had happened and how the place ended up like this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The World&#8217;s Will was supposed to be the last hope of the Profound Sword World. Yet, it unleashed destruction after awakening. It was even more terrifying than those Otherworldly Sky Demons!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The World&#8217;s Will isn&#8217;t what we think it is. It wants to destroy all of us…&#8221; Lin En revealed with a grave countenance, relating what he learned to everyone, including the origin of Mirror Lake and Sword City. The reason the ancient empire perished, and the Heaven-Exterminating War that led to the sealing of the World&#8217;s Will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had little knowledge of everything else, for it was only through the many souls of the Ancestors in Sword City that he knew all of this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could be traced back to tens of millions of years ago, before Shu Sect, Kong Mountain, and the other Forces were established. The Ancient Arcane Empire dominated Profound Sword World and nearly united the Thirteen States.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, a catastrophe caused the Ancient Arcane Empire to fall apart overnight and fade into the history of Profound Sword World, and Lin En happened to be the descendant of the Ancient Arcane Empire.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason the Ancient Arcane Empire would perish was that they angered heaven. They had touched upon what they shouldn&#8217;t have and glimpsed into the World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s goal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who&#8217;d have thought there&#8217;d be such a secret…&#8221; Lin En&#8217;s recount stupefied everyone as they reeled in immense shock. In fact, their worldview had been shattered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The World&#8217;s Will we have all been searching for all this time wanted to immolate us?! And a Heaven-Exterminating War broke out in this very land centuries ago?! Also, this war caused the Sword City to sink into the Mirror Lake, bringing the Ancient Arcane Empire to an end?!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Unbelievable…&#8221; Shock enveloped everyone, wrapping them in disbelief for a long time. This time, as they gazed at the terrifying, bloody eye, they no longer felt holiness but immense rage and animosity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did the Otherworldly Sky Demons want to conquer their land, but even the World&#8217;s Will that this world gave birth to was trying to obliterate everything as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, an angry roar burst out from the ancient battleships not far away. &#8220;Seize them! I can&#8217;t sense our Ancestors&#8217; auras anymore, but they survived! They must have something to do with the World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s revival. Seize every one of them! Kill whoever dares to flee!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that, many powerful soldiers charged towards the survivors of the Profound Sword World with various weapons in hand.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impassiveness and malice enveloped the gaze of the person charging in the forefront as he prepared to kill the survivors. At the same time, terrifying auras began stirring within the ancient battleships.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though many True Daoists from various Forces had descended into the depths of the ruins, a good number of Quasi-Nirvana Realm beings remained on the ship, outside of the small world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the World&#8217;s Will&#8217;s revival, the World Principles became chaotic, and the suppression it had on them had long declined. Thus, they could unleash most of their powers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the Abundance Sword Immortal and the others were quickly subdued, for as much as they defended with all their might, it was useless when they were facing Quasi-Nirvana Realm beings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What in the world happened? Why have our Ancestors&#8217; auras disappeared while you have all made it out alive?!&#8221; stormed a Godly Spirit Mountain expert.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivators from other Forces, too, interrogated the survivors of the Profound Sword World. Even Yu Feiya joined in with tightly furrowed brows and apprehension.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She, too, realised the aura of her Imperial Ancestor had vanished. It was likely he had died within the ruins.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin En swept his gaze across the surrounding cultivators, took a deep breath, and slowly said, &#8220;Gu Changge killed them all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He knew how significant Gu Changge was in the Upper Realm. Even the cultivators standing before him revered the man. However, it was also an indisputable fact that Gu Changge killed the group of True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin En didn&#8217;t want to take the blame for Gu Changge, nor did he have the ability to. Plus, if these people decided to seek Gu Changge for vengeance, it would alleviate some of this pressure and might open up a way for him to escape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You—&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the rest of the Profound Sword World survivors were stunned, shocked that Lin En would make such a bold decision and bluntly tell everyone the truth. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, they saw the event with their own eyes, but who would dare say it so casually?!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge was a terrifying being that could fight the World&#8217;s Will alone. In fact, he wouldn&#8217;t even need to kill anyone personally. That subordinate of his alone was enough to wipe everything out!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin En&#8217;s words caused everyone in the Upper Realm to turn even grim, and even more people were enveloped in malice. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nonsense! How dare you slander Young Master Gu?!&#8221; They denounced as they stepped forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Yu Feiya thought it wasn&#8217;t likely the case, she still couldn&#8217;t help shuddering slightly, for she believed it was very plausible for Gu Changge to do such a thing. She knew Gu Changge feared nothing ever since he admitted to killing Tuo Ba Xiao Yao. He wouldn&#8217;t even bat an eyelid even if he had to destroy this world. Thus, it wasn&#8217;t impossible for him to kill all of the True Daoists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ask the others if you don&#8217;t believe me. We saw it with our own eyes. Or do you people actually think we&#8217;re the ones who really killed them?&#8221; Lin En questioned composedly. After all, it was an indisputable fact, and he didn&#8217;t frame Gu Chagge either. The truth would reveal itself if they just looked into it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way I see it, you want to frame Young Master Gu! Now, why would he attack our ancestors?!&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impassiveness and malice enveloped the cultivator of the Godly Spirit Mountain as he unleashed a terrifying aura. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was evident he didn&#8217;t believe Lin En&#8217;s words at all. In his eyes, Gu Changge took a liking to his Ancestor, who buttered up to him. So he thought it was impossible for Gu Changge to kill his Ancestor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything, Lin En probably wanted them to hate Gu Changge so that Lin En could be the last man standing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re already standing before death, yet you want to drive a wedge between our relationship with Young Master Gu?! How ridiculous!&#8221; Monotoned another cultivator as he stepped forward. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Quasi-Nirvana energy he released suffocated the the Abundance Sword Immortal and the others, and since the restriction from the World had vanished, the victims couldn&#8217;t withstand the vast and boundless Quasi-Nirvana at all. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other cultivators&#8217; gazes were just as terrifying, and when they landed their gazes upon the Profound Sword World survivors, they were on the verge of ripping the skies apart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As dire as it was that their Ancestors&#8217; aura had vanished, offending Gu Changge was just as troublesome. Plus, Gu Changge would certainly kill them all on the spot once they found out Gu Changge was really the murderer. Hence, the best plan, for now, was to play dumb and only seek vengeance after they returned to the Upper Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, Lin En was oblivious to the Upper Realm cultivators&#8217; thoughts. So he continued shaking his head and defended himself. &#8220;Feel free to Soul Search me if you still don&#8217;t believe me! The others have also witnessed the event!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that, he pointed behind him at his fellow survivors. Those of the Shu Sect weren&#8217;t the only Earth Sword Immortals who managed to escape the small world. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Soul Search?&#8221; The countenances of the Abundance Sword Immortal and the others turned awful, for a soul was where a cultivator stored their cultivation. The slightest accident could compromise the cultivator.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If one was fortunate, one would turn into an idiot, whereas if their souls got severely searched, they might end up dead.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[How cruel of Lin En. He doesn&#8217;t see us as humans anymore!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You—&#8221; Many Earth Sword Immortals gazed furiously at Lin En, who, unfortunately, disregarded everyone with his impassive expression. Necessary sacrifices had to be made if they were to save Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way I see it, this guy has ulterior motives. Why would Young Master Gu ever do such a thing?! He&#8217;s merely defaming the Young Master&#8217;s name! Take him away. We&#8217;ll deal with him after Young Master Gu returns.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin En&#8217;s expression stiffened at once. He was in utter shock and incredulity, for he couldn&#8217;t believe these people made nothing of his words and even wanted to lock him up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[Do they fear Gu Changge that much?! So much so that they dare not question him?!]</span></p>

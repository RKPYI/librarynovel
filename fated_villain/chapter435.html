        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is that so…&#8221; </span><span id="more-30202"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous divine rainbows dashed through the sky. After the shocking commotion
                in the Demon-Burying Abyss, Gu Changge and the others immediately fled from the place without waiting a
                moment longer.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jiang Chuchu was shocked after listening to his explanation. She did
                not doubt Gu Changge&#8217;s words because she already had a feeling that Chosen Monk Jin Chan&#8217;s
                motives were impure back then. [Turns out my gut feeling was right.]</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This ended up being a slap in their faces. It turned out that the
                reason Chosen Monk Jin Chan told everyone to split up was because he had other plans. He had planned to
                release the Demoness sealed off in the Demon-Burying Abyss.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thought that Chosen Monk Jin Chan wouldn&#8217;t have the courage
                to do so, but it seemed that she had underestimated his courage. Moreover, this was the first time she
                had heard that the Buddhist Mountain had such a secret hidden for all these years. It all seemed too
                unbelievable that the former abbot of Buddhist Mountain would be bewitched by the Demoness in the
                Demon-Burying Abyss, have his Buddha Heart swayed, and thus lead to his betrayal of Buddhist Mountain.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big story would cause an uproar in the many forces of the Upper
                Realm!</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How powerful is the Demoness?&#8221; Jiang Chuchu asked when
                she remembered something else as important. [If the Demoness isn&#8217;t </span><i><span
                    style="font-weight: 400;">that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">strong, we can gather the
                various forces and send out experts to seal her off again.]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing this, Gu Changge glanced at Jiang Chuchu and shook his head.
                &#8220;She&#8217;s frighteningly powerful. The average True Daoists are probably no match for her.
                Don&#8217;t intervene as you please anymore. With her strength, I am afraid that the Upper Realm will be
                in shambles for quite some time.&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Chan Honyi hadn&#8217;t left the Demon-Burying Abyss yet, Gu Changge
                believed that she would show up in the Upper Realm very soon.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Floating Buddhist Temple near the Demon-Burying Abyss was
                definitely the first place she would appear at. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge didn&#8217;t need to bother himself with this for now. He could
                leave it to other forces nearby to worry about her. However, he did have to think of a way to end her
                revenge on him. The Zen robe of the Buddhist Mountain was one way to go about it, but that alone was far
                from enough.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[There will be a chance for us when Chan Honyi&#8217;s hostility subsides
                after a while. Judging from the situation, it was the power of the arrays that consumed her energy. When
                her energy is low, she seems to be in that composed personality of hers. In other words, she will stop
                killing when she has killed enough and needs to rest.] Gu Changge wasn&#8217;t too worried as he already
                had a countermeasure in mind.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for how many lives would be lost in the Upper Realm because of
                Chan Honyi&#8217;s emergence, this was not something he had to concern himself with. All he did was let
                Chan Honyi emerge before the expected time. The inevitable would still have happened… albeit in a
                different way.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[The average True Daoists are no match for her!?] Jiang Chuchu
                frowned with unease. She could only imagine how powerful the Demoness was for Gu Changge to warn others
                against her. Otherwise, he wouldn&#8217;t have kept everyone away the moment he came out of the
                Demon-Burying Abyss. This already showed how wary Gu Changge was of the Demoness. Before this, Gu
                Changge was always someone with a calm demeanour. He would most probably still stay calm even if the sky
                was falling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>
        <p></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She couldn&#8217;t help being curious about the dark, eerie figure who
                suddenly appeared beside Gu Changge like a guard. However, knowing that she would be probing at his
                secret, she decided against asking him questions. From the looks of it, the figure might have already
                surpassed the Sacred Emperor Realm. Frighteningly enough, its seeping energy alone was enough to crack
                open a person&#8217;s body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterwards, Gu Changge looked at her, and said in a soft voice,
                &#8220;You should go back to Mortal Palace and cultivate for now. Don&#8217;t worry about the other
                things happening outside.&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being the obedient person that she was, Jiang Chuchu ‘en’ softly in reply.
                She knew that this matter was of great importance. This was not the time for her to be willful. Gu
                Changge was only asking her to stay inside Mortal Palace out of worry for her.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">……</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the Demonic Energy outside the Demon-Burying Abyss was
                overwhelming as shockingly chilling hostility filled the air. A simple snowflake appeared out of nowhere
                and floated between the sky and the earth. Mixed with divine light, it was crystal clear, but there were
                also traces of blood. From it, terrifying visions reflected in the sky.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a sea of blood and a mountain of corpses and bones.
                Incomparably gorgeous and eye-catching blood-coloured lotus flowers could also be seen blooming as a
                beautiful woman in red, with her black hair wafting, strode out from the snow. Her energy felt cold and
                cruel, and her eyes seemed to be shooting out knives.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the anger and Demonic Energy within a radius of ten thousand kilometres
                trembled and covered the sky like a beacon. Everything she devoured then turned into gushing and vast
                energy. Afterwards, she lowered her indifferent gaze to look at the many beings who came here because of
                the commotion. All of them were powerful figures from the various forces. They were very powerful, and
                even the weakest was in the Sacred Lord Realm. But at this moment, they were covered in goosebumps as
                they felt a chill crawl up their backs. They felt as though they were being targeted by a
                predator.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who is this? Could this be the Demoness that has been sealed
                off at the depths of the Demon-Burying Abyss?&#8221; An important figure of one of the forces was
                trembling all over. He was in a daze after seeing the flawless face of the demoness in red, but he
                immediately wanted to step back when he came back to his senses. </span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Did the seal in the Demon-Burying Abyss break already!? But,
                that doesn&#8217;t make sense!&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were also people who were shaking out of fear, and they wanted
                to flee. A being with such strange energy was undoubtedly not normal. From the looks of it, she must
                have unfathomable strength. They knew that this was too dangerous a place to keep staying
                here.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;She&#8217;s definitely the Demoness who had been sealed off in
                the depths of the Demon-Burying Abyss. S-She&#8217;s had been freed…&#8221;</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who came to their senses felt the piercing eyes of the demoness
                in red on them. It was as though she wanted to see through them, and even annihilated their souls.
            </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, instead of looking at them as a whole, she was actually looking at
                their souls. After realising this, none of them dared to stay here any longer. Some of them even
                sacrificed their lifespan to activate their Secret Technique, combusting their body and turning into
                divine rainbows before fleeing away in fear. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who on earth released this Demoness? They&#8217;d better not let me
                find out who they are, or I&#8217;ll definitely kill them a thousand times over if I could! I&#8217;ll
                make them regret the day they were born!&#8221; Some of them were fervently cursing as regret and terror
                filled them. They were desperately using their Secret Technique to escape. As the saying went, curiosity
                killed the cat; they wouldn&#8217;t have come here out of curiosity if they had known that this kind of
                thing would happen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But within the next moment, boundless hostility and Demonic Energy
                enveloped everything underneath the sky. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is bad!&#8221; All those fleeing were terrified and in despair.
                Their souls were almost frozen, and it was difficult for them to escape from the reach of this Demonic
                Energy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demoness&#8217; eyes were devoid of emotions as a red glow filled
                the sky like blood-coloured falling stars. In an instant, the world seemed to be separated, and the
                terrifying murderous aura swept across the region, making countless stars tremble.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!* Just like that, she brought about mayhem in the world with
                the pointing of her finger. Her frightening power instantly penetrated all the people in front of her.
                As another roar sounded from the earth, everyone despaired and exploded, turning into Bloodmist as they
                lost both their bodies and souls.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an instant, the place not far from the Demon-Burying Abyss was
                stained with blood from the mass murder. The woman with a flawless face and fluttering hair started to
                take slow steps. Even so, her slightest movies would affect the World Principles of the surrounding
                area, as mountains and rivers began to melt away. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As though she knew where Gu Changge&#8217;s energy was going, she
                indifferently glided in the direction he had left with unhurried steps. All the beings she came across
                along the way to the gates of the Floating Buddhist Temple were slapped to death by her until she
                reached her destination.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she came to a stop, she could hear the sound of the knocking as
                Buddha aura shone brightly in all directions. She could feel the holiness and tranquillity in the air.
                However, she had a frown on her face as she didn&#8217;t seem to like the aura very much. With her
                sleeves rolled up, her Demonic Aura gushed out of her.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brilliant glow in front of the Floating Buddhist Temple made the
                sky dazzle with Buddha aura. Silhouettes of ancient monks, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas emerged then as
                they tried to resist this blow. All the monks rushed out with alarmed looks on their faces, but it only
                took a second for them to disappear, as they had turned into ashes or exploded into bloodmists. </span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were a few old monks with profound dharma who fought back for a while,
                only to cough up blood and collapse the next moment, their bodies and souls collapsed. Regardless of how
                many years they had been cultivating, they were like ants in the face of such a strong
                force.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Hum!* The next moment, a vast Buddha aura manifested and lit up the
                sky. An old monk with a kind face and grey eyebrows was sitting cross-legged when he opened his eyes and
                floated into the sky while he looked at the demoness in red from afar.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was saddened and disheartened by what happened here, but he was still
                going to persuade the demoness in red to let go of her hatred. &#8220;Amitabha. Please, let go of
                your—&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He chanted Buddha&#8217;s name. However, before he finished his words, he
                felt his scalp go numb… </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her slender, clear fingers like spring water had already pierced through the
                middle of his eyebrows, making him choke on the rest of his words. Still hanging onto his last breath of
                astonishment and shock, he wondered how she appeared beside him without him noticing. The light in his
                eyes finally dimmed, and he was released from this world.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Demoness&#8217; eyes were as sharp and cold as knives when she
                walked past his corpse. It was as if she thought of him as nothing but an eyesore, and all she did was
                crush a nobody to death. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a sea of blood and corpses by her feet, she continued to walk
                ahead.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">……</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Demonic Energy was overwhelming because of the great chaos in the
                Demon-Burying Abyss. All stars within a circle of thousands of kilometres turned dim. Not only that,
                many ancient cities had turned into barren lands in the blink of an eye.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news quickly spread everywhere, causing a huge commotion. Many
                were horrified to the extreme. The origin of the Demon-Burying Abyss, which spanned over countless
                epochs, was very mysterious and ancient. There were many Ancient Beings who guessed that the
                Demon-Burying Abyss had existed longer than many forces in the Upper Realm. In fact, it could even be
                traced back to the Forbidden Epoch that was buried in the River of Time.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, there was a terrifying energy in the Demon-Burying Abyss that
                felt as though a ferocious great demon had awakened, and was about to cover the world in blood. The
                magnitude of the impact caused by this incident was beyond imagination. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monk who wanted to know what kind of being was sealed in the Demon-Burying
                Abyss had once gone to investigate, but over time, the Demon-Burying Abyss was basically
                indistinguishable from the so-called Forbidden Areas in the eyes of the people. After all, none who went
                to the Burial Demon Abyss to investigate survived, despite some of them being in the Nirvana
                Realm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the event that caused the biggest stir was that Floating
                Buddhist Temple, the one responsible for guarding the Demon-Burying Abyss, had been turned into a sea of
                blood within a day. All the monks were reduced to ashes. Even an old monk in the Quasi-Nirvana Realm,
                too, had died instantly when his forehead was pierced through.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment this incident was made known to the public, everyone was
                overcome with unease. The Floating Buddhist Temple, which was in charge of making sure the great demons
                were contained in the Demon-Burying Abyss, had existed for a long time. Yet, all of it had been reduced
                to dust. They could imagine how terrifyingly powerful the Demoness was. She had been able to easily and
                brutally kill a Quasi-Nirvana Realm monk who had practised Buddhism for most of his life.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many were in dire straits. They were worried that she would start her
                killing spree after her emergence. They hadn&#8217;t thought of a way to deal with her for now. However,
                there are also a lot of people who were puzzled by the situation. They knew that the seal in the
                Demon-Burying Abyss could last at least half a year, and that was why it didn&#8217;t make sense for the
                Demoness to emerge so soon. They couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if there was more to this than meets the
                eye. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an attempt to put a calm to the disaster, Gu Changge, the Saintess of
                Mortal Palace, Chosen Monk Jin Chan and some other people had all gone to the Demon-Burying Abyss to
                subdue the Demoness before she emerged. People couldn&#8217;t help but grow suspicious of the
                group&#8217;s involvement in this matter. Such coincidences didn&#8217;t make sense otherwise.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, only a handful of people escaped from the Demon-Burying Abyss
                this time, while the rest of the experts died in the one-sided fight. There were rumours that the
                Buddhist Mountain was the one that suffered from the biggest loss, as Chosen Monk Jin Chan was the only
                one who got out of it alive.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The racket caused by this matter was by no means small, but the
                forces behind Gu Changge, the Saintess of Mortal Palace, and Chosen Monk Jin Chan were mighty. No one
                dared to gossip about it/ Still, this problem had to be dealt with. It was also necessary to find out
                the reason the demoness in red managed to get out of the seal.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, everyone soon learned of another shocking news again.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What!? That Demoness was released by Chosen Monk Jin
                Chan!?&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many who received the news were shocked, and they stood there
                dumbfounded. They couldn&#8217;t begin to imagine if that was really the case. A lot of forces started
                to kick up a fuss as well, as the force that spread the news was the Mortal Palace. There must be proof
                and basis for them to put the blame on Buddhist Mountain for no reason.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The real reason Chosen Monk Jin Chan went to the Demon-Burying
                Abyss was to take away a Buddhist Mountain treasure that was sealed at the depths of the abyss. It was
                because of this that the seal was loosened, and the Demoness could break free. Also, Chosen Monk Jin
                Chan was once the abbot of the Floating Buddhist Temple. He had his Buddha Heart charmed and swayed by
                the Demoness, and in order to expel the demonic nature from her, he stole the treasure, only for him to
                end up dead for some reason.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How unexpected of Buddhist Mountain to hide such a scandal for
                so many years…&#8221;</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many were left astounded by the shocking news. They found it hard to believe
                that something like this had happened to Buddhist Mountain, which regarded itself as pure. The abbots of
                the Floating Buddhist Temple were said to be geniuses rarely seen in Buddhist Mountain in thousands of
                years. They possessed the heart and wisdom of Buddha, and were destined to become an Immortal in the
                future. Yet, someone like that went astray and was bewitched by the demoness in red. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the party involved, Buddhist Mountain, didn&#8217;t give any
                response even after the scandalous news was known to the public. To many, this was Buddhist
                Mountain&#8217;s way of giving their tacit confirmation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden, righteous indignation filled many, and some experts
                even went to the Buddhist Mountain to demand an explanation. Some of their people had died tragically at
                the hands of the Demoness, after all. But, they dared not go to her for revenge.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the rise of angry voices from all factions, Buddhist Mountain
                chose to remain silent. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many had rushed over to Buddhist Mountain to seek justice. The
                demoness in red wouldn&#8217;t have emerged ahead of time and disrupted their plans if Chosen Monk Jin
                Chan hadn&#8217;t loosened the seal..</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this, crowds forced their way to the Buddhist Mountain to
                demand an explanation. No matter what, to the eyes of others, Chosen Monk Jin Chan was deeply involved
                in all this.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">……</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Buddhas were shining brightly in the resplendent hall of Buddhist
                Mountain. They were incomparably holy as their bodies flowed with Buddhist cadence. Many monks with
                profound cultivation had gathered here. Chosen Monk Jin Chan was here as well, but he had sadness,
                anger, helplessness, and more than anything, calmness, written all over his face. He didn&#8217;t seem
                perturbed by the rumours going on outside.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am at fault for my carelessness in the handling of this matter.
                Buddhist Mountain failed to hold its ground and this barely has anything to do with Chosen Monk Jin
                Chan.&#8221; </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person speaking at this moment was a benevolent old monk draped in shabby
                monk robes. He exuded a faint energy that seemed non-existent at times. In fact, there was no one like
                him anywhere, be it the Upper Realm or Lower Realm. His cultivation had reached an unfathomable level
                that couldn&#8217;t be described in words. His eyes were calm and clear, but they also contained a depth
                and profoundness as various mysteries and Principles of the World swam in them. The evolution of the
                universe and the collapse of the heavens could be seen in his eyes.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chosen Monk Jin Chan was now kneeling on the floor with his head
                hung. He had a look of guilt on his face as he faced the old monk, Abbot Ru Fo, who was the current
                abbot of Buddhist Mountain.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe you. You were only plotted against by Gu Changge.
                You&#8217;re lucky to have been able to come back alive.&#8221; Ru Fo slightly shook his head, the
                gentle look on his face putting Chosen Monk Jin Chan at ease.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chosen Monk Jin Chan felt a wave of relief wash away his worries when
                he heard that. It would be a challenge for even Buddhist Mountain to protect him when various forces
                were demanding an explanation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This filled him with rage, but he felt even more so powerless. No
                matter how much he tried to explain himself, it would be difficult to change anything. Even if he
                explained that he was going to help maintain the seal with another treasure after he took the Zen robe,
                no one would believe him. Everyone might even get more furious, believing he was just making
                excuses.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Changge had the complete upper hand now. Chosen Monk Jin Chan even
                felt that the reason the demoness in red had emerged early was because Gu Changge took the Buddhist
                Mountain treasure away for himself. In the end, Gu Changge beat him up, framed him, and even revealed
                the story of his previous life, which wasn&#8217;t all that glorious.</span><span
                style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
            </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though technically, it was Mortal Palace who spread the news,
                Chosen Monk Jin Chan refused to believe that Gu Changge didn&#8217;t have a hand in this. From Gu
                Changge&#8217;s various conducts, Chosen Monk Jin Chan was enraged, and also frightened by how scary an
                opponent he was dealing with. </span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gu Channgge had unhesitantly let out the Demoness and brought calamity to the
                world. Furthermore, he did all that and pushed the blame onto him for that one treasure. Worse, in
                return, he had walked away with both the treasure and a good reputation despite the harm he
                caused.</span></p>

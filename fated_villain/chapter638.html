        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment news spread, there was an immediate uproar in the Thirteen States of the Profound Sword World. Countless were alarmed by the news and they quickly swarmed towards the Ancient Arcane Ruins. </span><span id="more-34803"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even those from the Upper Realm, in ancient battleships hovering up in the air, in the Outer Territory, caught news of it/ They wasted no time in reporting it to their higher-ups. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone was tempted to make a move.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one spared any attention to how this news came about. All eyes were on the Ancient Arcane Ruins. If Mirror Lake indeed turned out to be within the ruins, both cultivators of the Profound Sword World and the Upper Realm would surely send out their most powerful men to seize it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To everyone in Profound Sword World, their last ray of hope was hidden in Mirror Lake. To those of the Upper Realm, on the other hand, Mirror Lake most likely contained the World Source, which was an opportunity for many True Daoists to grow even more powerful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that instant, a raging storm erupted in Profound Sword World.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many ancient battleships broke their momentum and charged in the ruins&#8217; direction. Numerous Forces in the Thirteen States also dispatched troops to hurry over. They needed to protect this place as soon as possible. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flames of war all across the land continued to burn brighter as too many people were destroyed in the fire. The battle between the two worlds had now reached the most critical moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Who leaked the information about this place? Great. Now, the entire Thirteen States are in a state of panic. Who knows what kind of accident will happen when everyone comes here?&#8221; The Abundance Sword Immortal and some others were the first to arrive at Ancient Arcane Ruins. They each sported a gloomy look on their faces. None of them knew how news about this place was spread.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their initial plan was to secretly find Mirror Lake, and then awaken the World’s Will sleeping in it to force the Upper Realm Army to retreat. But now that the news about this place was everywhere, the Upper Realm Army would definitely not sit still. Because of that, accidents were bound to happen, and things would only get more troublesome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There is a possibility that someone else has found out something from deduction. However, we haven&#8217;t found a trace of the lake even though we have been searching for days. If there are more people, there may be some unexpected discoveries,&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal said softly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people agreed with what she said. If it weren&#8217;t for the signs of divination that pointed at this place, they would have doubted whether or not Mirror Lake was actually here. It wasn&#8217;t like there was any result even after they had been searching for several days. Anyone else would have given up at this point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What I&#8217;m worried about now is whether Young Master Gu will find us insincere when he hears of this,&#8221; an Earth Sword Immortal lamented. They considered Gu Changge their absolute benefactor. Not only did he tell them how they could fend themselves against the Upper Realm, but he also never made things difficult for them. Despite all that, they were still wary of Gu Changge, and they ended up coming here for Mirror Lake without his knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Someone of his status shouldn&#8217;t care about such things.&#8221; The Snow Sword Immortal lightly shook her head. However, there was still unconcealable worry on her face under the mask.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They could foresee a fight here with the experts from the Upper Realm Forces. The supreme experts had never come here in their true bodies because they were afraid of the power of this world. However, the resistance had obviously weakened after the incarnation of the World’s Will was torn apart by Gu Changge on the day when Shu Sect was involved. If those supreme experts would take the risk, they would definitely descend in their true bodies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid an all-out fight is unavoidable when the time comes. We might all lose our lives here,&#8221; the Abundance Sword Immortal sighed. He understood the Snow Sword Immortal&#8217;s concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the next few days, the entire Profound Sword World was in a state of chaos. Cultivator after cultivator rushed to Ancient Arcane Ancestral Temple, and figures wielding Divine Swords could be seen appearing on every mountain range.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first ones here were the wandering cultivators from all Thirteen States. But by the end of it, almost every Force had sent their strongest Hidden powers. They knew that an unimaginable battle would break out here. Knowing that no one could escape unscathed, they all tried their best to contribute in this battle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal and others also gave up their plan to continue searching for Mirror Lake. They were now waiting for the experts from all regions of the Thirteen States. Some Earth Sword Immortals who had gone into deep seclusion long ago also showed up instead of staying in hiding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People from the Southern Light Empire had also come here as soon as they could. Princess Xuan Dea, the Second Most Graceful Damsel of Southbarren State, was among them. Her tall and slender figure was adorned with a light-coloured long dress. On top of that, she had silky locks, a fair and delicate complexion, and deep eyes like a lake in autumn. The slight furrow of her dark eyebrows left people intoxicated, and they wanted nothing more than to ease her worries. Her appearance which could bring disaster to her country and people was truly captivating.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was accompanied by Ah Qing and many others from the younger generation, all of whom were their generation&#8217;s leading figures in the Profound Sword World. The most powerful among them had already reached the Seventh Realm. As ones with boundless prospects, they were likely to enter the Earth Sword Immortal Realm in the future.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The final battle is about to break out here. We will be smashed to smithereens if we get involved.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one who spoke was a purple-clad young man within the group. With his handsome face and extraordinary way of speaking, he was the receiver of plenty of inconspicuous admiring gazes from the young women around him. He was Chen Li, the leader of the Four Heroes of Profound Sword World. His grandfather was a veteran Earth Sword Immortal who was terrifyingly powerful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s unavoidable that one would fight desperately when confronting mortal danger. We must be here for the future of the Profound Sword World,&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea sighed softly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing that, Chen Li smiled and comforted her, &#8220;I will keep you safe if things get dangerous. I have many protective items that Grandfather gave me.&#8221; It was no secret that his grandfather was an Earth Sword Immortal. The protective items that he bestowed on Chen Li were definitely powerful. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone seemed extremely envious after hearing his words. The young women, especially, wished they had taken Princess Xuan Dea&#8217;s place. Many people know that Chen Li had always been pursuing Princess Xuan Dea, but the princess was always indifferent to his passionate attempts. Now that the Profound Sword World was facing a catastrophe, he had many more opportunities to approach Princess Xuan Dea as the leader of the younger generation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s alright. In times of danger, please save yourself, Brother Chen. I am not worthy of your protection.&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea shook her head and politely rejected Chen Li&#8217;s kindness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smile on Chen Li&#8217;s face froze a bit, but he recovered quickly as he continued, &#8220;Even an Earth Sword Immortal might not survive if a great battle breaks out here. Xuan Dea, you have to be careful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I understand, so don&#8217;t worry, Brother Chen.&#8221; The princess nodded, her attitude was indifferent. Even though Chen Li was a patient man who didn&#8217;t let his emotions show, he was visibly in a foul mood after being rejected by Princess Xuan Dea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, the few people beside him saw this and hurriedly spoke up and changed the subject. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Young Master Chen is extremely powerful. He will definitely be one of the Earth Sword Immortals in another few hundred years…&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;After the disaster relating to the Otherworldly Sky Demons has been put to rest, it won&#8217;t take long for Young Master Chen to become the strongest person in the Profound Sword World!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen Li only looked like he was in a better mood after he heard the words full of flattery a few people threw his way. The Southern Light Empire would fall into ruins if there was no Earth Sword Immortal to personally attend to the garrison. Although Princess Xuan Dea was indifferent towards him, he believed that she would come and beg for his help when the final battle commenced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when all the younger generations from Profound Sword World had gathered here, shocking waves of Sword Qi spread from above the sky. The leader was a tall and tough-looking elderly man dressed in purple. He had a long sword with lingering wisps of sword aura on his back. One could easily tell that he was terrifyingly strong.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instant Chen Li saw him, he put on a happy face and called out, &#8220;Grandfather! You&#8217;re here!&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This person was Chen Li&#8217;s grandfather, Chen Beili, who was known as the Parting North Sword Immortal. He used to fight against enemies from all over the world while he wielded his Parting North Divine Sword in one hand. Despite that, he had never found a worthy opponent. Even his eldest apprentice was halfway in the Earth Sword Immortal Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turning solemn, Princess Xuan Dea, Ah Qing and the others also looked at the elderly man. Even the Abundance Sword Immortal, the Sect Master of the Shu Sect, was once a student of this man.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even a respected elder like Parting North Sword Immortal has come&#8230;&#8221; There was a big commotion here at that instant. Many people were excited as they looked at the man who was once a legendary figure. The Abundance Sword Immortal, the Snow Sword Immortal, and the rest of them had no choice but to show their respect by coming to greet him in person.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the Parting North Sword Immortal didn&#8217;t greet the many Earth Sword Immortals when he came here. He only looked at his beloved grandson.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I told you that this is a dangerous place, and yet, you insisted on coming here. Who will be my Successor if something were to happen to you?&#8221; Even though he was scolding Chen Li, his tone was laced with a hint of concern. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon hearing that, Chen Li replied in a sombre voice, &#8220;Grandfather, I am the leader of the Profound Sword World&#8217;s younger generation. How can I retreat during dangerous times? Wouldn&#8217;t I be an embarrassment to your name?&#8221; The look on his face was solemn as he righteously insisted, evoking the admiration of the onlooking crowd. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abundance Sword Immortal and everyone else who rushed here were also quietly praising the man worthy of his title as the leader of the Four Heroes of Profound Sword. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ha…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You&#8217;re all grown now, aren&#8217;t you? You don&#8217;t even listen to me anymore…&#8221; Parting North Sword Immortal seemingly shook his head in resignation, but his tone sounded satisfied. The next moment, he turned to Princess Xuan Dea and stated, &#8220;It will be good for you young ones to get along during troubled times. I suggest you tone down on your arrogance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen Beili knew his grandson quite well, and he knew that Chen Li had a crush on Princess Xuan Dea. However, he wasn&#8217;t pleased when he saw Princess Xuan Dea&#8217;s attitude just now. She was not as good as Chen Li in terms of family background, and even worse in terms of talent. He thought she had no right to behave so proudly. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised by those unexpected words Parting North Sword Immortal said to her, Princess Xuan Dea suddenly turned slightly pale. The people from the Southern Light Empire behind her also reacted the same as her. Their eyes were fearful, and they dared not speak much. No matter what, Abundance Sword Immortal, Snow Sword Immortal, and the others were mere juniors in front of the veteran Earth Sword Immortal. Hailing from the small Southern Light Empire where there was no Earth Sword Immortal to represent them, they didn&#8217;t have anything backing them up to talk to Parting North Sword Immortal confidently. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I have learnt my lesson, Senior,&#8221; Princess Xuan Dea whispered. She had visibly turned pale. She wanted to ask her master Snow Sword Immortal for help, but when she thought about how Snow Sword Immortal had also been taught by Parting North Sword Immortal when she took her last step, and that speaking up on the princess&#8217; behalf now probably wasn&#8217;t the best thing to do, Princess Xuan Dea could only lower her head and mutter a soft reply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was a princess, but her status was of no use at a time like this. She couldn&#8217;t help feeling aggrieved. [Am I wrong for rejecting Chen Li even though I feel nothing for him and he is the one who keeps pestering me? Is this just because his grandfather is a veteran Earth Sword Immortal?] For some reason, Princess Xuan Dea suddenly thought of a figure in white. Even though the figure&#8217;s strength was unmatched in this world, he was still gentle and approachable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Xuan Dea doesn&#8217;t like Chen Li. Also, she has someone she fancies.&#8221; Ah Qing, who had been watching all this with indifference, suddenly made an announcement that made the looks on everyone&#8217;s faces change. Even Chen Li&#8217;s face fell. Princess Xuan Dea, too, opened her beautiful eyes wide in shock. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parting North Sword Immortal obviously didn&#8217;t expect someone to be brave enough to stand up and disobey him. With a grim face, he turned to Ah Qing and hummed, &#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? I&#8217;m curious who is more brilliant than my grandson.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah Qing&#8217;s sleek brows were pulled together when she heard that. Just as she was about to say something, there was a sudden tremor from beyond the sky. All the Cultivators here felt as though their souls were being repressed, and they could hardly move as chills enveloped their bodies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That is… The Otherworldly Sky Demons are coming this way!&#8221; someone exclaimed in a terrified and shaky voice when they saw the scene in the distance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Rumble!*</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a dark Demonic Cloud that was constantly rolling over and covering everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancient battleships hovering outside the sky rumbled and approached them like an Ancient Continent. The momentum was overwhelming as pools of Principles and Chaos Qi surrounded the ships, their radiance frightening.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the terrifying Otherworldly Sky Demon Army finally descended here, they cast black shadows across thousands of kilometres of the void around Ancient Arcane Ruins. Many eerie, ghostly figures surrounded by thick fog stood on these ancient battleships. They were tall, quiet, and extremely indifferent as they swept across the broken walls and ruins below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the threat of their arrival was so terrifying and overwhelming that everyone in Profound Swordt World shuddered in fear. Even Abundance Sword Immortal and the others felt afraid to the point their scalps were numb. Although these terrifying phantoms were not at the same level as the Earth Sword Immortals, they had definitely reached the Ninth Realm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abundance Sword Immortal and the rest of them could fight against the invaders!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the frightening thing was that there were too many of these figures. Their standing in the sky alone instilled great fear in everyone. Those from Profound Sword World didn&#8217;t even know if there was an existence even more terrifying standing behind these figures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This day has finally arrived. The final battle with these Otherworldly Sky Demons is probably inevitable,&#8221; a white-bearded Earth Sword Immortal uttered gloomily. At this moment, too many people had come to Ancient Arcane Ruins. All of them could only watch things unfold as fear consumed them. Trembling, they each had a look of despair on their faces drained of blood.</span></p>

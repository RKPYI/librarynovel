      <h4>
        Chapter 257-1: This guy seems to be the Sea King, An Ancient freak from
        the Golden Unicorn family (1)
      </h4>
      <p>
        The jet-black aura of Absolute Heavenly Extinction spread between the
        heavens and the earth, making the whole space look gloomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the distance, there were fluctuations of battle, and there were
        creatures with dark eyes who were fighting against the young
        cultivators. The aftermath was very terrifying, and the black fog was so
        thick that the surrounding area of thousands of miles was affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young creature that was attacked was very extraordinary, and its
        fighting power was very strong. However, it did not affect their
        arrival.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were actually quite a few such scenes on the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield right now, and many battles had been breaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quota of True Immortal Academy had made many younger generations
        crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even Gu Changge and Wang Ziji, who were recognized as the most powerful
        of the younger generation, still needed to kill these creatures in order
        to gain points and enter the True Immortal Academy to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
        So there was no such thing as going through the back door and relying on
        relationships. At this time, all beings were equal, and as long as they
        had points, they could enter the academy to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>"Since Brother Gu said so, then we have to split temporarily."</p>
      <p>
        On the top of the depleted mountain, there were many strange stones with
        strange appearances. The two of them stood side by side, like a pair of
        immortals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji was wearing a long light blue dress, with her hands behind her
        back, smiling, the air around her was ethereal and clean, showing
        flawlessness and perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
        She had a special aura on her body that attracted the spiritual energy
        of Heaven, and her whole body was filled with the energy of Immortal
        spirits, as if she could fly away at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes even Gu Changge couldn't help but want to swallow her up. This
        kind of breath was not only as simple as the Immortal spirit, but there
        was another spirit in her body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge guessed that it was her golden finger or a companion. But he
        just thought about it, Wang Ziji's methods were hundreds of times more
        difficult than those Ancient freaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Wang Ziji would not affect his follow-up plans. Gu Changge
        thought that he had not yet reached the point of madness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Wang Ziji had plans on him, why didn't he have plans for Wang
        Ziji? This person was greedy for his body and wanted to attack him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge wanted to see who would attack who in the end. At the moment,
        he couldn't help but smile and said, "The Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield is not too big, maybe we will meet again someday. Also,
        thank you for what happened just now. If you didn't give me face at the
        time, I might not be able to step down."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wang Ziji didn't know if he really thanked him, or if he was just
        talking on the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, she still said with a smile on her face, "Even if Brother
        Gu really wants to thank me, then that’s fine. You owe me a favor, and
        you can remember it later."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge smiled and said, "Okay, then I'll leave first."</p>
      <p>
        Seeing Gu Changge talking like this and not paying much attention to
        Jiang Chuchu's affairs, Wang Ziji didn't ask much. She was just a little
        curious why Jiang Chuchu's expression towards Gu Changge was extremely
        cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was very different from the Jiang Chuchu she knew well. As a woman,
        she had a natural instinct for this kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially after being nurtured by various dog-blood episodes in her
        previous life, she always felt that this matter was a bit resentful of
        women.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9472-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671914a50782c0a8ea39d49",
            id: "pf-9472-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        It was very difficult for a man like Gu Changge to be tempted by any
        woman. The surface was gentle and jade-like, but it was nothing more
        than disguising the indifference in his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, she didn't know what happened between Gu Changge and Jiang
        Chuchu. The descendant of the Human Ancestor Hall who walked outside
        some time ago was actually a fake arranged by Gu Changge.
      </p>
      <p>"Then we will part for now," Wang Ziji replied with a smile.</p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded. Then, with a hum, he took a step forward, his figure
        disappeared, and he appeared thousands of miles away in an instant.
      </p>
      <p>Even Wang Ziji couldn't keep up with his speed at this time.</p>
      <p>
        "This guy… He is so elusive why is he not interested in me…? Am I not
        attractive enough?" Wang Ziji couldn't help rubbing her eyebrows.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the first time in her life that she felt tempted by someone. But
        Gu Changge's attitude made her think that he didn't seem to be
        interested in women, as if he was chasing supreme power.
      </p>
      <p>But judging from Gu Changge's many actions, this was not the case.</p>
      <p>He easily got a good impression on that Ying Yu.</p>
      <p>
        "This guy seems to be like the Sea King. Forget it, the more I think
        about it, the more headache I get. I don't believe this guy's heart is
        made of rock…"
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterward, Wang Ziji left this place. She planned to venture deep into
        the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        And now, Jiang Chuchu seemed to be trapped in there. Her life and death
        was unknown.
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        "Master, this area has been occupied by us, and the Heavenly Extinction
        creatures in it have been cleaned up. Most of the cultivation bases are
        around the False God Realm, and there are very few True God Realm…"
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, after Gu Changge and Wang Ziji separated, he went to
        find his followers. At this moment, Ye Han was respectfully reporting on
        their gains after entering the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        "It seems that our area is on the periphery, and the real powerhouses
        are still located in the depths."
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge nodded, his eyes swept away the area of ??tens of thousands
        of miles, there were no other young creature to be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, because of his name, those people would not dare to stay here
        for a long time unless they wanted to offend him.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the followers also had the corpses of Heavenly Extinction
        creatures in their hands, waiting to leave this place and go to the True
        Immortal Academy to exchange for points.
      </p>
      <p>
        A place in the True Immortal Academy required a lot of points, and it
        was completely insufficient for beings in the False God realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Gu Changge didn't intend to ask for these points in their
        hands. For him, it was enough to just go to the depths and kill a
        Quasi-Sacred Realm creature casually.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of his coming to the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield was not
        for the quota of the True Immortal Academy. He had to make some
        arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were still a lot of things to do, and there was no time to waste
        on killing Heavenly Extinction beings.
      </p>
      <div id="pf-9473-1">
        <script>
          window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];
          window.pubfuturetag.push({
            unit: "6671915950782c0a8ea39d68",
            id: "pf-9473-1",
          });
        </script>
      </div>
      <p>
        The jade pendant he gave to Wang Ziji actually had his seal on it. Wang
        Ziji probably didn't notice it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge planned to let her go to find the way for him first, and
        then he would find a way to sneak into the land of Heavenly Extinction
        and see if he could find the core of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as he knew, the existence of Absolutely Heavenly Extinction was
        inseparable from the core area that existed when it was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        For countless years, the outbreak of the Absolute Heavenly Extinction
        involved many worlds, and the almost incomprehensible devouring power
        was enough to make all existences fear it. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m
        nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
      </p>
      <p>
        In the core area, there was the original substance that gave birth to
        the absolute Heavenly Extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge planned to devour it with his Great Dao treasure bottle. It
        was not impossible, and there was also an almighty Destiny Value. For
        these, Gu Changge had made a lot of preparations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the Heavenly Extinction aura in the depths of the land of
        Absolute Heavenly Extinction was very strong, and ordinary creatures
        couldn't stick to that kind of place at all as they would be swallowed
        by the Heavenly Extinction aura on the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gu Changge was not worried about any strong existence that would get in
        the way of his plans. The scope of this Heavenly Extinction Battlefield
        in front of him was quite large, but the area occupied by Ye Han and the
        others was actually still small.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge thought about it and intended to cover their ears and
        simply instructed.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well done, but with this amount of points, it's still far from enough.
        This is my token, if anyone dares to interfere next, use it to notify
        me. I'll leave this place for a while."
      </p>
      <p>
        After saying that, he threw the token in his hand to Ye Han. His
        identity was very special, many people were staring at him, at this time
        if he wanted to do something, it would be very troublesome.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Gu Changge planned to take off his shell in gold, using the excuse of
        leaving the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield, so that fewer young
        existences would pay attention to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the time comes, there would also be much less trouble. Seeing this
        scene, the rest of the followers couldn't help but be envious, being
        able to get the token given by the master meant that Ye Han was highly
        valued.
      </p>
      <p>
        They did not have such an honor. Ye Han was also excited as he
        respectfully accepted the token, and hurriedly said, "Master, please
        rest assured, this subordinate will definitely complete the task you
        entrusted to me."
      </p>
      <p>Gu Changge nodded, "I'm still at ease with your work."</p>
      <p>
        Saying that his figure left this place, and he quickly disappeared
        without a trace.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I wonder what the reason is for the master to leave the Heavenly
        Extinction Battlefield, is there something big going on outside?"
      </p>
      <p>
        After seeing Gu Changge leave, a heavenly girl with a pretty face
        couldn't help but ask with some doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't know, the Master's affairs, and it's not something we can ask."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's better to finish what Master has explained first, with Master's
        identity around, when we encounter a Heavenly Extinction being, not many
        people would dare to compete with us, this is a good opportunity to
        enter the True Immortal Academy."
      </p>
      <p>
        A few followers next to him smiled and shook their heads, not daring to
        ask more questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many young existences then did notice that Gu Changge’s figure had
        appeared at the entrance place of the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield.
      </p>
      <p>
        He seemed to have left the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield and returned
        to the outside world. This news made many people a little uncomfortable,
        Gu Changge was now deservedly dominant in the young generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the Heavenly Emperor's Son, Ying Shuang, acould not help but weaken
        a few chips in front of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that Gu Changge was no longer in the Heavenly Extinction Battlefield
        the competition had weakened, frankly speaking, many people were
        relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Heavenly Extinction Battlefield was a huge territory, and the area
        where Gu Changge was located was only a very small area. The news about
        him also spread only in a small area and did not make a big ripple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ying Yu, Ye Langtian, Wang Ziji, and others did hear about it, but each
        one had a different look and different thoughts.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Chapter 257-2: 3: This guy seems to be the Sea King, An Ancient freak

        ><strong>2</strong><strong>)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>……</p>
      <p>
        "Young master, further ahead is the depths of the battlefield. There are
        already many Heavenly Extinction beings in the God King Realm in the
        vicinity, if we go in further, I'm afraid we will encounter beings of
        the Quasi-Sacred Realm, or even the Sacred realm."
      </p>
      <p>
        "And the Heavenly Extinction aura there is too dense, I worry that many
        people will not be able to bear it."
      </p>
      <p>
        In front of a lake that had long since withered and dried up. A group of
        beings appeared here and were riding powerful beasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The deer, pixie, qilin, etc., the aura was amazing, with clouds under
        their feet, looking unusually steely and heroic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one who spoke at this moment was a young creature with a rhinoceros
        horn on his head, his strength was True God Realm, and he was also a
        young supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No harm, some people follow me into the front, some people stay here
        and wait, don't let the people behind you to come in."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Heavenly Extinction beings nearby are no longer enough for us to
        kill, if we can meet a Quasi-Sacred Realm being by then, it will save us
        a lot of trouble."
      </p>
      <p>
        "I heard that Gu Changge has already left the Heavenly Extinction
        Battlefield, this is my chance to crush him in terms of points! The
        number one of the younger generation is not that easy to be!"
      </p>
      <p>
        The young master he spoke of was a tall young man, very handsome,
        wearing a golden robe.
      </p>
      <p>
        His golden hair was as bright and dazzling as the sun as if it was
        flowing with gold, and his eyes were also golden as if they were two
        small burning suns.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, there were two golden dragon horns above his head, in the
        flow of some kind of Dao rhythm divine might, very extraordinary. But he
        was not a dragon rather the young master from the Qilin family, or more
        rarely seen Golden qilin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Qilin son, an Ancient freak sealed to this day, his cultivation had
        reached the Quasi-Sacred Realm.
      </p>
      <p>
        His father was a Qilin Demon Emperor, who was once dominant in the Demon
        Realm, and the cultivation world. Although he had never ruled the Demon
        world, his own power had made many Ancient races afraid of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He inherited his father's horrific talent, and now, at the age of just
        over twenty, he already had such strength. Even if it was not sealed, he
        could still be proud of his strength among his peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the Golden Qilin had a special talent that could tend to good
        fortune and avoid disasters, and in some ways, it could even reach the
        point of foreseeing the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although many powerful existences, after reaching a certain Realm, could
        peer into the long river of time and notice the scales of the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        But they would also suffer a backlash. The Golden Qilin, however, would
        not have such a situation, and in a way, this was a clan beloved by
        heaven and earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, hearing him say this, a group of his followers nodded, a
        part of those who knew it was difficult to continue to move forward
        stayed behind, while most of them chose to follow.
      </p>
      <p>"Who is it……"</p>
      <p>
        However, just at this moment, his face suddenly changed, and a divine
        light burst out from his eyes, like a sharp sword, looking at the dome
        of the sky behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        His expression, too, became grave, sensing an uneasy, dangerous
        atmosphere that enveloped the neighborhood.

        This was his intuition, a gift from the Golden Qilin clan. It made his
        brow sting as if it was pierced through by a steel needle. His head was
        going to explode. The danger of this one was beyond imagination!
      </p>
      <p>"What's going on?"</p>
      <p>"What's wrong with the young master?"</p>
      <p>
        The group of followers behind the Qilin, who had not yet reacted, were
        surprised and looked behind them in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>What was there but a miserable and gloomy sky dome?</p>
      <p>"Be careful, the one who is coming is not good!"</p>
      <p>
        The Qilin said in a deep voice. Almost instantly, he unfolded a vast
        star field map behind himself.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Buzz!!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        A terrifying aura, like billions of strands of starlight converging,
        bloomed here.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a sacred weapon, a bright and real star, was refined into it
        with great divine power, and was now flowing, emitting rumbling and
        turning sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        A star emerged and instantly solidified, draped with chaotic mist,
        interweaving vast runes in the high sky! It must be said that the
        Qilin's reaction was too fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        This action out, feeling himself a few security, he only slightly
        breathed a sigh of relief, his gaze was cold, staring closely at the
        distant high sky.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Since you're here, why don't you show yourself?" The Qilin shouted.
      </p>
      <p>
        His words also caused a group of followers to be alert, sacrificing all
        kinds of divine weapons and waiting in a strict position.
      </p>
      <p>"Tsk tsk……"</p>
      <p>
        "The reaction is quite fast, but my Master has ordered me, so today, I
        will take your origin. Everyone, including you, will not be able to
        escape."
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with a chilling cold laughing sound, three terrifying and
        monstrous figures emerged in the high sky. They were clad in black
        robes, their bodies were covered in black fog, and their faces could not
        be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only their scarlet pair of eyes could be seen, and there was a cold,
        crazy, bloodthirsty intention in them. The cultivation realm shown by
        them had made everyone below change their expression, and they even
        became frightened, trembling all over!
      </p>
      <p>Three Great Sacred Realm cultivators!</p>
      <p>
        The sky trembled, the laws and order were about to collapse, and even
        the nearby Heavenly Extinction aura became surging.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master… Is this… Have we offended someone?"</p>
      <p>"How is it possible that these are three Great Sacred…"</p>
      <p>
        The expressions of Qilin's followers changed dramatically, their faces
        turned pale, and some people asked in disbelief.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Great Sacred Realm cultivator was now an invincible existence. Not to
        mention that there were three Great Sacred Realm existences in front of
        them!
      </p>
      <p>
        With this kind of posture, whoever saw it, would be terrified, their
        soul would tremble, and they would feel despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Are you with the inheritor of demonic art? I have no enmity with him,
        why would he deal with me?"
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, Qilin's expression was also very solemn, a little pale,
        giving birth to a strong sense of unease and danger.
      </p>

      <p>But compared to the rest, he was much calmer.</p>
      <p>
        In his golden eyes, the rune disappeared and turned into a terrifying
        power, trying to gain insight into the origins of these three Great
        Sacred Realm existences.
      </p>
      <p>
        From their words just now, he had already guessed their origins. In
        addition to the inheritor of demonic art, who would take the origin of
        people?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was just that Qilin couldn't figure out why the other party would be
        so daring to send three Great Sacred Realm existences to kill him at
        such a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an invincible existence under the Quasi-Supreme, there were three of
        them all at once, which was almost a mortal situation for any younger
        generation. This made Qilin give birth to a strong danger. Fôll0w
        current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)
      </p>
      <p>
        "You are not stupid, but no one can save you today. If you are obedient,
        you will hand over your origin, and maybe you will be left with a whole
        body."
      </p>
      <p>"My master is very interested in your origin."</p>
      <p>
        In the sky, a black shadow said with a sneer, his eyes were extremely
        cruel, showing ruthlessness, overlooking everyone below.
      </p>
      <p>As he spoke.</p>
      <p><strong>Boom!!</strong></p>
      <p>
        He attacked, his big black hand stretched out, covering the sky, the
        talisman was destroyed, and all directions seemed to become dark all at
        once as if a large continent was covered and pressed down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the might of the Great Sacred Realm, any resistance seemed
        extremely insignificant.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other two watched indifferently and didn't make a move, just to
        prevent someone from escaping here.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Puff!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Almost in an instant, the big black palm fell, and the sound of collapse
        sounded one after another from below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accompanied by the screams, Qilin's followers, even if they had a
        powerful forbidden weapon to protect themselves, at this time, many
        people were still unable to resist even for a breath, and they were
        photographed into a cloud of blood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Including their primordial spirit and weapons, their body and spirit
        were instantly destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>"Young Master, help me!"</p>
      <p>"We don't want to die!"</p>
      <p>
        Those who survived had some lingering fears, their faces were pale and
        desperate, and they shouted at Qilin.
      </p>
      <p>"Let's be honest, maybe I'll die happily."</p>
      <p>
        In the shadows, such a cruel and indifferent voice came, like a goddess
        aloof, looking down on the ants.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Stop! Aren't you afraid that the forces behind me will know and take
        revenge?"
      </p>
      <p>Qilin's expression suddenly became ugly and gloomy to the extreme.</p>
      <p>
        He began to urge the star field map behind him, and the stars turned,
        and the terrifying divine might flowed, and they were about to be
        crushed down.
      </p>
      <p>
        But he was only at a Quasi-Sacred Realm, and the gap between him and the
        real Great Sacred Realm was too great.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other party just waved it casually, and the rules of the Great
        Sacred pressed down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The star field map shattered and terrifying cracks appeared, and the
        refined stars were directly turned into powder.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What's there to fear? All of you will die here today, and who would
        know that we killed you."
      </p>
      <p>
        The black shadow sneered again, very disdainful, with an attitude of
        wanting to kill them all.
